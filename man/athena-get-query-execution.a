.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns information about a single execution of a query if you have access to the workgroup in which the query ran. Each time a query executes, information about the query execution is saved with a unique ID.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-query\-execution\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique ID of the query execution.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

The unique identifier for each query execution.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Query \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The SQL query statements which the query execution ran.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
StatementType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of query statement that was run. \fBDDL\fP indicates DDL query statements. \fBDML\fP indicates DML (Data Manipulation Language) query statements, such as \fBCREATE TABLE AS SELECT\fP . \fBUTILITY\fP indicates query statements other than DDL and DML, such as \fBSHOW CREATE TABLE\fP , or \fBDESCRIBE <table>\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ResultConfiguration \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The location in Amazon S3 where query results were stored and the encryption option, if any, used for query results. These are known as "client\-side settings". If workgroup settings override client\-side settings, then the query uses the location for the query results and the encryption configuration that are specified for the workgroup.
.sp
OutputLocation \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The location in Amazon S3 where your query results are stored, such as \fBs3://path/to/query/bucket/\fP . To run the query, you must specify the query results location using one of the ways: either for individual queries using either this setting (client\-side), or in the workgroup, using  WorkGroupConfiguration . If none of them is set, Athena issues an error that no output location is provided. For more information, see \fI\%Query Results\fP . If workgroup settings override client\-side settings, then the query uses the settings specified for the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EncryptionConfiguration \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If query results are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates the encryption option used (for example, \fBSSE\-KMS\fP or \fBCSE\-KMS\fP ) and key information. This is a client\-side setting. If workgroup settings override client\-side settings, then the query uses the encryption configuration that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query results specified in the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and \fI\%Workgroup Settings Override Client\-Side Settings\fP .
.sp
EncryptionOption \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether Amazon S3 server\-side encryption with Amazon S3\-managed keys (\fBSSE\-S3\fP ), server\-side encryption with KMS\-managed keys (\fBSSE\-KMS\fP ), or client\-side encryption with KMS\-managed keys (CSE\-KMS) is used.
.sp
If a query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup overrides client\-side settings, then the workgroup\(aqs setting for encryption is used. It specifies whether query results must be encrypted, for all queries that run in this workgroup.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
KmsKey \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For \fBSSE\-KMS\fP and \fBCSE\-KMS\fP , this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

The completion date, current state, submission time, and state change reason (if applicable) for the query execution.
.sp
State \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The state of query execution. \fBQUEUED\fP indicates that the query has been submitted to the service, and Athena will execute the query as soon as resources are available. \fBRUNNING\fP indicates that the query is in execution phase. \fBSUCCEEDED\fP indicates that the query completed without errors. \fBFAILED\fP indicates that the query experienced an error and did not complete processing. \fBCANCELLED\fP indicates that a user input interrupted query execution.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Athena automatically retries your queries in cases of certain transient errors. As a result, you may see the query state transition from \fBRUNNING\fP or \fBFAILED\fP to \fBQUEUED\fP .

.sp
DataManifestLocation \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The location and file name of a data manifest file. The manifest file is saved to the Athena query results location in Amazon S3. The manifest file tracks files that the query wrote to Amazon S3. If the query fails, the manifest file also tracks files that the query intended to write. The manifest is useful for identifying orphaned files resulting from a failed query. For more information, see \fI\%Working with Query Results, Output Files, and Query History\fP in the \fIAmazon Athena User Guide\fP .

If the user requests Auto, the effective engine version is chosen by Athena. When a request to update the engine version is made by a \fBCreateWorkGroup\fP or \fBUpdateWorkGroup\fP operation, the \fBEffectiveEngineVersion\fP field is ignored.

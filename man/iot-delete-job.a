.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a job and its related job executions.
.sp
Deleting a job may take time, depending on the number of job executions created for the job and various other factors. While the job is being deleted, the status of the job will be shown as "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS". Attempting to delete or cancel a job whose status is already "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" will result in an error.
.sp
Only 10 jobs may have status "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" at the same time, or a LimitExceededException will occur.
.sp

.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-job\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the job to be deleted.
.sp
After a job deletion is completed, you may reuse this jobId when you create a new job. However, this is not recommended, and you must ensure that your devices are not using the jobId to refer to the deleted job.

\fB\-\-force\fP | \fB\-\-no\-force\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) When true, you can delete a job which is "IN_PROGRESS". Otherwise, you can only delete a job which is in a terminal state ("COMPLETED" or "CANCELED") or an exception will occur. The default is false.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Deleting a job which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause a device which is executing the job to be unable to access job information or update the job execution status. Use caution and ensure that each device executing a job which is deleted is able to recover to a valid state.

\fB\-\-namespace\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer\-managed job.
.sp
When you specify a value for this parameter, AWS IoT Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the value in the following format.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

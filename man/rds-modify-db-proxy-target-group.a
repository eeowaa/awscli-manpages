.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the new target group to assign to the proxy.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-db\-proxy\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the new proxy to which to assign the target group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-connection\-pool\-config\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The settings that determine the size and behavior of the connection pool for the target group.
.sp
MaxConnectionsPercent \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the \fBmax_connections\fP setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group.
.sp
Default: 100
.sp
Constraints: between 1 and 100
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MaxIdleConnectionsPercent \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the \fBmax_connections\fP setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group.
.sp
Default: 50
.sp
Constraints: between 0 and \fBMaxConnectionsPercent\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ConnectionBorrowTimeout \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions.
.sp
Default: 120
.sp
Constraints: between 1 and 3600, or 0 representing unlimited
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SessionPinningFilters \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior.
.sp
Default: no session pinning filters
.sp
(string)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
InitQuery \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with \fBSET\fP statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single \fBSET\fP statement, such as \fBSET x=1, y=2\fP .
.sp
Default: no initialization query

\fB\-\-new\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The new name for the modified \fBDBProxyTarget\fP . An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can\(aqt end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
DBProxyTargetGroup \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The settings of the modified \fBDBProxyTarget\fP .
.sp
DBProxyName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier for the RDS proxy associated with this target group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
TargetGroupName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier for the target group. This name must be unique for all target groups owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
TargetGroupArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the target group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
IsDefault \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Whether this target group is the first one used for connection requests by the associated proxy. Because each proxy is currently associated with a single target group, currently this setting is always \fBtrue\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The current status of this target group. A status of \fBavailable\fP means the target group is correctly associated with a database. Other values indicate that you must wait for the target group to be ready, or take some action to resolve an issue.

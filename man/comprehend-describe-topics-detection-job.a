.sp
\fB\-\-job\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier assigned by the user to the detection job.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

InputDataConfig \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The input data configuration supplied when you created the topic detection job.
.sp
S3Uri \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of data files.
.sp
For example, if you use the URI \fBS3://bucketName/prefix\fP , if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
InputFormat \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBONE_DOC_PER_FILE\fP \- Each file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBONE_DOC_PER_LINE\fP \- Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages.

OutputDataConfig \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The output data configuration supplied when you created the topic detection job.
.sp
S3Uri \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you use the \fBOutputDataConfig\fP object with asynchronous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The location is used as the prefix for the actual location of the output file.
.sp
When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an output file in a directory specific to the job. The \fBS3Uri\fP field contains the location of the output file, called \fBoutput.tar.gz\fP . It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the operation.

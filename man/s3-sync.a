.sp
\fB\-\-follow\-symlinks\fP | \fB\-\-no\-follow\-symlinks\fP (boolean)
Symbolic links are followed only when uploading to S3 from the local filesystem. Note that S3 does not support symbolic links, so the contents of the link target are uploaded under the name of the link. When neither \fB\-\-follow\-symlinks\fP nor \fB\-\-no\-follow\-symlinks\fP is specified, the default is to follow symlinks.
.sp

Specify an explicit content type for this operation. This value overrides any guessed mime types.
.sp
\fB\-\-cache\-control\fP (string)
Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
.sp
\fB\-\-content\-disposition\fP (string)
Specifies presentational information for the object.
.sp

\fB\-\-source\-region\fP (string)
When transferring objects from an s3 bucket to an s3 bucket, this specifies the region of the source bucket. Note the region specified by \fB\-\-region\fP or through configuration of the CLI refers to the region of the destination bucket. If \fB\-\-source\-region\fP is not specified the region of the source will be the same as the region of the destination bucket.
.sp
\fB\-\-only\-show\-errors\fP (boolean)
Only errors and warnings are displayed. All other output is suppressed.
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-progress\fP (boolean)

.sp
\fB\-\-ignore\-glacier\-warnings\fP (boolean)
Turns off glacier warnings. Warnings about an operation that cannot be performed because it involves copying, downloading, or moving a glacier object will no longer be printed to standard error and will no longer cause the return code of the command to be \fB2\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-force\-glacier\-transfer\fP (boolean)
Forces a transfer request on all Glacier objects in a sync or recursive copy.
.sp
\fB\-\-request\-payer\fP (string)

In order to copy the appropriate properties for multipart copies, some of the options may require additional API calls if a multipart copy is involved. Specifically:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmetadata\-directive\fP may require additional \fBHeadObject\fP API calls.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdefault\fP may require additional \fBHeadObject\fP, \fBGetObjectTagging\fP, and \fBPutObjectTagging\fP API calls. Note this list of API calls may grow in the future in order to ensure multipart copies preserve the exact properties a \fBCopyObject\fP API call would preserve.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want to guarantee no additional API calls are made other than than the ones needed to perform the actual copy, set this option to \fBnone\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-metadata\-directive\fP (string)
Sets the \fBx\-amz\-metadata\-directive\fP header for CopyObject operations. It is recommended to use the \fB\-\-copy\-props\fP parameter instead to control copying of metadata properties. If \fB\-\-metadata\-directive\fP is set, the \fB\-\-copy\-props\fP parameter will be disabled and will have no affect on the transfer.
.sp
\fB\-\-size\-only\fP (boolean)
Makes the size of each key the only criteria used to decide whether to sync from source to destination.
.sp
\fB\-\-exact\-timestamps\fP (boolean)

.sp
\fB\-\-delete\fP (boolean)
Files that exist in the destination but not in the source are deleted during sync.
.sp

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
The following \fBsync\fP command syncs objects under a specified prefix and bucket to files in a local directory by
uploading the local files to s3.  A local file will require uploading if the size of the local file is different than
the size of the s3 object, the last modified time of the local file is newer than the last modified time of the s3
object, or the local file does not exist under the specified bucket and prefix.  In this example, the user syncs the
bucket \fBmybucket\fP to the local current directory.  The local current directory contains the files \fBtest.txt\fP and
\fBtest2.txt\fP\&.  The bucket \fBmybucket\fP contains no objects:

The following \fBsync\fP command syncs objects under a specified prefix and bucket to objects under another specified
prefix and bucket by copying s3 objects.  A s3 object will require copying if the sizes of the two s3 objects differ,
the last modified time of the source is newer than the last modified time of the destination, or the s3 object does not
exist under the specified bucket and prefix destination.  In this example, the user syncs the bucket \fBmybucket\fP to
the bucket \fBmybucket2\fP\&.  The bucket \fBmybucket\fP contains the objects \fBtest.txt\fP and \fBtest2.txt\fP\&.  The bucket
\fBmybucket2\fP contains no objects:

The following \fBsync\fP command syncs files in a local directory to objects under a specified prefix and bucket by
downloading s3 objects.  A s3 object will require downloading if the size of the s3 object differs from the size of the
local file, the last modified time of the s3 object is newer than the last modified time of the local file, or the s3
object does not exist in the local directory.  Take note that when objects are downloaded from s3, the last modified
time of the local file is changed to the last modified time of the s3 object.  In this example, the user syncs the
current local directory to the bucket \fBmybucket\fP\&.  The bucket \fBmybucket\fP contains the objects \fBtest.txt\fP and
\fBtest2.txt\fP\&.  The current local directory has no files:

The following \fBsync\fP command syncs objects under a specified prefix and bucket to files in a local directory by
uploading the local files to s3.  Because the \fB\-\-delete\fP parameter flag is thrown, any files existing under the
specified prefix and bucket but not existing in the local directory will be deleted.  In this example, the user syncs
the bucket \fBmybucket\fP to the local current directory.  The local current directory contains the files \fBtest.txt\fP and
\fBtest2.txt\fP\&.  The bucket \fBmybucket\fP contains the object \fBtest3.txt\fP:

existing both in s3 and locally will be excluded from the sync.  In this example, the user syncs the bucket \fBmybucket\fP
to the local current directory.  The local current directory contains the files \fBtest.jpg\fP and \fBtest2.txt\fP\&.  The
bucket \fBmybucket\fP contains the object \fBtest.jpg\fP of a different size than the local \fBtest.jpg\fP:

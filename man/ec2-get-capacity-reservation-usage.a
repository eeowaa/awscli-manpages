.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gets usage information about a Capacity Reservation. If the Capacity Reservation is shared, it shows usage information for the Capacity Reservation owner and each AWS account that is currently using the shared capacity. If the Capacity Reservation is not shared, it shows only the Capacity Reservation owner\(aqs usage.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-capacity\-reservation\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the Capacity Reservation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the returned \fBnextToken\fP value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If \fBmaxResults\fP is given a larger value than 500, you receive an error.
.sp
Valid range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 1000.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fP | \fB\-\-no\-dry\-run\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \fBDryRunOperation\fP . Otherwise, it is \fBUnauthorizedOperation\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.IP \(bu 2
\fBpending\fP \- The Capacity Reservation request was successful but the capacity provisioning is still pending.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfailed\fP \- The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A request might fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests are retained for 60 minutes.

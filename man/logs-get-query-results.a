.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns the results from the specified query.
.sp
Only the fields requested in the query are returned, along with a \fB@ptr\fP field, which is the identifier for the log record. You can use the value of \fB@ptr\fP in a \fI\%GetLogRecord\fP operation to get the full log record.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBGetQueryResults\fP does not start a query execution. To run a query, use \fI\%StartQuery\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the value of the \fBStatus\fP field in the output is \fBRunning\fP , this operation returns only partial results. If you see a value of \fBScheduled\fP or \fBRunning\fP for the status, you can retry the operation later to see the final results.

The ID number of the query.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
results \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The log events that matched the query criteria during the most recent time it ran.
.sp
The \fBresults\fP value is an array of arrays. Each log event is one object in the top\-level array. Each of these log event objects is an array of \fBfield\fP /\fBvalue\fP pairs.
.sp

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo disassociate a Resolver rule from an Amazon VPC\fP
.sp
The following \fBdisassociate\-resolver\-rule\fP example removes the association between the specified Resolver rule and the specified VPC. You can disassociate a rule from a VPC in the following circumstances:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For DNS queries that originate in this VPC, you want Resolver to stop forwarding queries to your network for the domain name that is specified in the rule.
.IP \(bu 2
You want to delete the forwarding rule. If a rule is currently associated with one or more VPCs, you must disassociate the rule from all VPCs before you can delete it.

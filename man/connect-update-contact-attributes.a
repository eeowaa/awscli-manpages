.SH NAME
connect-update-contact-attributes \- Creates or updates user-defined contact attributes associated with the specified contact
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates or updates user\-defined contact attributes associated with the specified contact.
.sp
You can create or update user\-defined attributes for both ongoing and completed contacts. For example, while the call is active, you can update the customer\(aqs name or the reason the customer called. You can add notes about steps that the agent took during the call that display to the next agent that takes the call. You can also update attributes for a contact using data from your CRM application and save the data with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for additional analysis, such as legal review or to identify abusive callers.
.sp
Contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are then deleted. For information about CTR retention and the maximum size of the CTR attributes section, see \fI\%Feature specifications\fP in the \fIAmazon Connect Administrator Guide\fP .

\fBImportant:\fP You cannot use the operation to update attributes for contacts that occurred prior to the release of the API, which was September 12, 2018. You can update attributes only for contacts that started after the release of the API. If you attempt to update attributes for a contact that occurred prior to the release of the API, a 400 error is returned. This applies also to queued callbacks that were initiated prior to the release of the API but are still active in your instance.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

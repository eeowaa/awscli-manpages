\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
RuleGroup \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the rule group. You cannot change the name of a rule group after you create it.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Id \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the rule group. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Capacity \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group.
.sp
When you create your own rule group, you define this, and you cannot change it after creation. When you add or modify the rules in a rule group, AWS WAF enforces this limit. You can check the capacity for a set of rules using  CheckCapacity .
.sp
AWS WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. AWS WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.sp
Rules \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The  Rule statements used to identify the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. Each rule includes one top\-level statement that AWS WAF uses to identify matching web requests, and parameters that govern how AWS WAF handles them.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A single rule, which you can use in a  WebACL or  RuleGroup to identify web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. Each rule includes one top\-level  Statement that AWS WAF uses to identify matching web requests, and parameters that govern how AWS WAF handles them.
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the rule. You can\(aqt change the name of a \fBRule\fP after you create it.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Priority \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you define more than one \fBRule\fP in a \fBWebACL\fP , AWS WAF evaluates each request against the \fBRules\fP in order based on the value of \fBPriority\fP . AWS WAF processes rules with lower priority first. The priorities don\(aqt need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Statement \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The AWS WAF processing statement for the rule, for example  ByteMatchStatement or  SizeConstraintStatement .
.sp
ByteMatchStatement \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A rule statement that defines a string match search for AWS WAF to apply to web requests. The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want AWS WAF to search, and other settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the AWS WAF console and the developer guide, this is refered to as a string match statement.
.sp
SearchString \-> (blob)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A string value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches only in the part of web requests that you designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.
.sp
Valid values depend on the component that you specify for inspection in \fBFieldToMatch\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMethod\fP : The HTTP method that you want AWS WAF to search for. This indicates the type of operation specified in the request.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUriPath\fP : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the URI path, for example, \fB/images/daily\-ad.jpg\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fBSearchString\fP includes alphabetic characters A\-Z and a\-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBIf you\(aqre using the AWS WAF API\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specify a base64\-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64\-encode it is 50 bytes.
.sp
For example, suppose the value of \fBType\fP is \fBHEADER\fP and the value of \fBData\fP is \fBUser\-Agent\fP . If you want to search the \fBUser\-Agent\fP header for the value \fBBadBot\fP , you base64\-encode \fBBadBot\fP using MIME base64\-encoding and include the resulting value, \fBQmFkQm90\fP , in the value of \fBSearchString\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBIf you\(aqre using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Body \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
.sp
Note that only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. If you don\(aqt need to inspect more than 8 KB, you can guarantee that you don\(aqt allow additional bytes in by combining a statement that inspects the body of the web request, such as  ByteMatchStatement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of the request. AWS WAF doesn\(aqt support inspecting the entire contents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
InvalidFallbackBehavior \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
What AWS WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEVALUATE_AS_STRING\fP \- Inspect the body as plain text. AWS WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMATCH\fP \- Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. AWS WAF applies the rule action to the request.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBNO_MATCH\fP \- Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you don\(aqt provide this setting, AWS WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.
.sp
AWS WAF does its best to parse the entire JSON body, but might be forced to stop for reasons such as invalid characters, duplicate keys, truncation, and any content whose root node isn\(aqt an object or an array.
.sp
AWS WAF parses the JSON in the following examples as two valid key, value pairs:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Missing comma: \fB{"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}\fP

TextTransformations \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. If you specify one or more transformations in a rule statement, AWS WAF performs all transformations on the content of the request component identified by \fBFieldToMatch\fP , starting from the lowest priority setting, before inspecting the content for a match.
.sp

SqliMatchStatement \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Attackers sometimes insert malicious SQL code into web requests in an effort to extract data from your database. To allow or block web requests that appear to contain malicious SQL code, create one or more SQL injection match conditions. An SQL injection match condition identifies the part of web requests, such as the URI or the query string, that you want AWS WAF to inspect. Later in the process, when you create a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or block requests that appear to contain malicious SQL code.

A rate\-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5\-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.

.UNINDENT
.sp
In this rate\-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both of the conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet both conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.
.sp
You cannot nest a \fBRateBasedStatement\fP , for example for use inside a \fBNotStatement\fP or \fBOrStatement\fP . It can only be referenced as a top\-level statement within a rule.
.sp
Limit \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
ByteMatchStatement \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A rule statement that defines a string match search for AWS WAF to apply to web requests. The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want AWS WAF to search, and other settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the AWS WAF console and the developer guide, this is refered to as a string match statement.
.sp
SearchString \-> (blob)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A string value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches only in the part of web requests that you designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.
.sp
Valid values depend on the component that you specify for inspection in \fBFieldToMatch\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMethod\fP : The HTTP method that you want AWS WAF to search for. This indicates the type of operation specified in the request.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUriPath\fP : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the URI path, for example, \fB/images/daily\-ad.jpg\fP .

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specify a base64\-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64\-encode it is 50 bytes.
.sp
For example, suppose the value of \fBType\fP is \fBHEADER\fP and the value of \fBData\fP is \fBUser\-Agent\fP . If you want to search the \fBUser\-Agent\fP header for the value \fBBadBot\fP , you base64\-encode \fBBadBot\fP using MIME base64\-encoding and include the resulting value, \fBQmFkQm90\fP , in the value of \fBSearchString\fP .

RateBasedStatement \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A rate\-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5\-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.
.sp
When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
.sp
You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate\-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate\-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.
.IP \(bu 2
A string match statement that searches in the User\-Agent header for the string BadBot.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this rate\-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both of the conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet both conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.

RateBasedStatement \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A rate\-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5\-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.
.sp
When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
.sp
You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate\-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate\-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.
.IP \(bu 2
A string match statement that searches in the User\-Agent header for the string BadBot.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this rate\-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both of the conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet both conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.

The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the AWS WAF console and the developer guide, this is refered to as a string match statement.
.sp
SearchString \-> (blob)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A string value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches only in the part of web requests that you designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.
.sp
Valid values depend on the component that you specify for inspection in \fBFieldToMatch\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMethod\fP : The HTTP method that you want AWS WAF to search for. This indicates the type of operation specified in the request.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUriPath\fP : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the URI path, for example, \fB/images/daily\-ad.jpg\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fBSearchString\fP includes alphabetic characters A\-Z and a\-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBIf you\(aqre using the AWS WAF API\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specify a base64\-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64\-encode it is 50 bytes.
.sp
For example, suppose the value of \fBType\fP is \fBHEADER\fP and the value of \fBData\fP is \fBUser\-Agent\fP . If you want to search the \fBUser\-Agent\fP header for the value \fBBadBot\fP , you base64\-encode \fBBadBot\fP using MIME base64\-encoding and include the resulting value, \fBQmFkQm90\fP , in the value of \fBSearchString\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBIf you\(aqre using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

RateBasedStatement \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A rate\-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5\-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.
.sp
When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
.sp
You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate\-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate\-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.
.IP \(bu 2
A string match statement that searches in the User\-Agent header for the string BadBot.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this rate\-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both of the conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet both conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.
.sp
You cannot nest a \fBRateBasedStatement\fP , for example for use inside a \fBNotStatement\fP or \fBOrStatement\fP . It can only be referenced as a top\-level statement within a rule.

RateBasedStatement \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A rate\-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5\-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.
.sp
When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
.sp
You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate\-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate\-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.
.IP \(bu 2
A string match statement that searches in the User\-Agent header for the string BadBot.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this rate\-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both of the conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet both conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.

.INDENT 3.5
A rule statement used to search web request components for matches with regular expressions. To use this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

RateBasedStatement \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A rate\-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5\-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.
.sp
When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
.sp
You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate\-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate\-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.
.IP \(bu 2
A string match statement that searches in the User\-Agent header for the string BadBot.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this rate\-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both of the conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet both conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.

LockToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token used for optimistic locking. AWS WAF returns a token to your get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete. AWS WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a \fBWAFOptimisticLockException\fP . If this happens, perform another get, and use the new token returned by that operation.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-recovery\-point\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point to use for the copy job; for example, arn:aws:backup:us\-east\-1:123456789012:recovery\-point:1EB3B5E7\-9EB0\-435A\-A80B\-108B488B0D45.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-source\-backup\-vault\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of a logical source container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the AWS Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-destination\-backup\-vault\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a destination backup vault to copy to; for example, \fBarn:aws:backup:us\-east\-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-iam\-role\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the IAM role ARN used to copy the target recovery point; for example, \fBarn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-idempotency\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls to \fBStartCopyJob\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-lifecycle\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains an array of \fBTransition\fP objects specifying how long in days before a recovery point transitions to cold storage or is deleted.
.sp
Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, on the console, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.
.sp
Only Amazon EFS file system backups can be transitioned to cold storage.
.sp
MoveToColdStorageAfterDays \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
DeleteAfterDays \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus \fBMoveToColdStorageAfterDays\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
CopyJobId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Uniquely identifies a copy job.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CreationDate \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The date and time that a copy job is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of \fBCreationDate\fP is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves information about the specified IAM user, including the user\(aqs creation date, path, unique ID, and ARN.
.sp
If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the request to this operation.
.sp
See also: AWS API Documentation
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-user\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the user to get information about.
.sp
This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to the user making the request. This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
User \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure containing details about the IAM user.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Due to a service issue, password last used data does not include password use from May 3, 2018 22:50 PDT to May 23, 2018 14:08 PDT. This affects \fI\%last sign\-in\fP dates shown in the IAM console and password last used dates in the \fI\%IAM credential report\fP , and returned by this operation. If users signed in during the affected time, the password last used date that is returned is the date the user last signed in before May 3, 2018. For users that signed in after May 23, 2018 14:08 PDT, the returned password last used date is accurate.
.sp
You can use password last used information to identify unused credentials for deletion. For example, you might delete users who did not sign in to AWS in the last 90 days. In cases like this, we recommend that you adjust your evaluation window to include dates after May 23, 2018. Alternatively, if your users use access keys to access AWS programmatically you can refer to access key last used information because it is accurate for all dates.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Path \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path to the user. For more information about paths, see \fI\%IAM identifiers\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
UserName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The friendly name identifying the user.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
UserId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see \fI\%IAM identifiers\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Arn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see \fI\%IAM Identifiers\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CreateDate \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The date and time, in \fI\%ISO 8601 date\-time format\fP , when the user was created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PasswordLastUsed \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The date and time, in \fI\%ISO 8601 date\-time format\fP , when the user\(aqs password was last used to sign in to an AWS website. For a list of AWS websites that capture a user\(aqs last sign\-in time, see the \fI\%Credential reports\fP topic in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . If a password is used more than once in a five\-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The user never had a password.
.IP \(bu 2
A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A null value does not mean that the user \fInever\fP had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.
.sp
This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PermissionsBoundary \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
PermissionsBoundaryType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Tags with a key name of \fBCost Center\fP might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AWS always interprets the tag \fBValue\fP as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma\-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.INDENT 3.5
The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53 DNS records that AWS Cloud Map creates when you register an instance and specify this service.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records, specify \fBWEIGHTED\fP for the routing policy.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can specify the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
MULTIVALUE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.
.sp
For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for one \fBA\fP record and a health check. You use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.
.sp
If you don\(aqt define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.
.sp
For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see \fI\%Multivalue Answer Routing\fP in the \fIRoute 53 Developer Guide\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
WEIGHTED
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can\(aqt route more or less traffic to any instances.
.sp
For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for one \fBA\fP record and a health check. You use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy.
.sp
If you don\(aqt define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected instance.

.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record when you register an instance, specify \fBA\fP or \fBAAAA\fP for \fBType\fP .
.sp
You specify other settings, such as the IP address for \fBA\fP and \fBAAAA\fP records, when you register an instance. For more information, see \fI\%RegisterInstance\fP .
.sp
The following values are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AAAA
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
CNAME
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see \fI\%Attributes\fP in the topic \fI\%RegisterInstance\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
You must specify \fBWEIGHTED\fP for the value of \fBRoutingPolicy\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
You can\(aqt specify both \fBCNAME\fP for \fBType\fP and settings for \fBHealthCheckConfig\fP . If you do, the request will fail with an \fBInvalidInput\fP error.
.sp
SRV
.UNINDENT
.sp
Route 53 returns the value for an \fBSRV\fP record. The value for an \fBSRV\fP record uses the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBpriority weight port service\-hostname\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note the following about the values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The values of \fBpriority\fP and \fBweight\fP are both set to \fB1\fP and can\(aqt be changed.
.IP \(bu 2
The value of \fBport\fP comes from the value that you specify for the \fBAWS_INSTANCE_PORT\fP attribute when you submit a \fI\%RegisterInstance\fP request.
.IP \(bu 2
The value of \fBservice\-hostname\fP is a concatenation of the following values:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
The value that you specify for \fBInstanceId\fP when you register an instance.
.IP \(bu 2
The name of the service.
.IP \(bu 2
The name of the namespace.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, if the value of \fBInstanceId\fP is \fBtest\fP , the name of the service is \fBbackend\fP , and the name of the namespace is \fBexample.com\fP , the value of \fBservice\-hostname\fP is the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBtest.backend.example.com\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you specify settings for an \fBSRV\fP record, note the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you specify values for \fBAWS_INSTANCE_IPV4\fP , \fBAWS_INSTANCE_IPV6\fP , or both in the \fBRegisterInstance\fP request, AWS Cloud Map automatically creates \fBA\fP and/or \fBAAAA\fP records that have the same name as the value of \fBservice\-hostname\fP in the \fBSRV\fP record. You can ignore these records.
.IP \(bu 2
If you\(aqre using a system that requires a specific \fBSRV\fP format, such as HAProxy, see the \fI\%Name\fP element in the documentation about \fBCreateService\fP for information about how to specify the correct name format.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
TTL \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this record.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Alias records don\(aqt include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the AWS resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the \fBAWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME\fP attribute when you submit a \fI\%RegisterInstance\fP request, the \fBTTL\fP value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or non\-alias records.

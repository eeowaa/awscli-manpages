.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Disables server\-side encryption (SSE) for the delivery stream.
.sp
This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke it, Kinesis Data Firehose first sets the encryption status of the stream to \fBDISABLING\fP , and then to \fBDISABLED\fP . You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is \fBDISABLING\fP . It can take up to 5 seconds after the encryption status changes to \fBDISABLED\fP before all records written to the delivery stream are no longer subject to encryption. To find out whether a record or a batch of records was encrypted, check the response elements  PutRecordOutput$Encrypted and  PutRecordBatchOutput$Encrypted , respectively.
.sp
To check the encryption state of a delivery stream, use  DescribeDeliveryStream .
.sp
If SSE is enabled using a customer managed CMK and then you invoke \fBStopDeliveryStreamEncryption\fP , Kinesis Data Firehose schedules the related KMS grant for retirement and then retires it after it ensures that it is finished delivering records to the destination.
.sp
The \fBStartDeliveryStreamEncryption\fP and \fBStopDeliveryStreamEncryption\fP operations have a combined limit of 25 calls per delivery stream per 24 hours. For example, you reach the limit if you call \fBStartDeliveryStreamEncryption\fP 13 times and \fBStopDeliveryStreamEncryption\fP 12 times for the same delivery stream in a 24\-hour period.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-delivery\-stream\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the delivery stream for which you want to disable server\-side encryption (SSE).

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

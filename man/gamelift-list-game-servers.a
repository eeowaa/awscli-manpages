\fBlist\-game\-servers\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBGameServers\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-game\-server\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An identifier for the game server group to retrieve a list of game servers from. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-sort\-order\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates how to sort the returned data based on game server registration timestamp. Use \fBASCENDING\fP to retrieve oldest game servers first, or use \fBDESCENDING\fP to retrieve newest game servers first. If this parameter is left empty, game servers are returned in no particular order.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GameServerData \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game client or service when it requests information on game servers using  ListGameServers or  ClaimGameServer .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ClaimStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates when an available game server has been reserved for gameplay but has not yet started hosting a game. Once it is claimed, the game server remains in \fBCLAIMED\fP status for a maximum of one minute. During this time, game clients connect to the game server to start the game and trigger the game server to update its utilization status. After one minute, the game server claim status reverts to null.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
UtilizationStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new games or is busy. Possible statuses include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAVAILABLE\fP \- The game server is available to be claimed. A game server that has been claimed remains in this status until it reports game hosting activity.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUTILIZED\fP \- The game server is currently hosting a game session with players.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
RegistrationTime \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Timestamp that indicates when the game server was created with a  RegisterGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \fB"1469498468.057"\fP ).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
LastClaimTime \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \fB"1469498468.057"\fP ). This value is used to calculate when a claimed game server\(aqs status should revert to null.

.UNINDENT
.sp
LastHealthCheckTime \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was updated with health status using an  UpdateGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \fB"1469498468.057"\fP ). After game server registration, this property is only changed when a game server update specifies a health check value.

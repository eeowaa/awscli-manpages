.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The AWS account that you\(aqre transferring the domain to must accept the transfer. If the other account doesn\(aqt accept the transfer within 3 days, we cancel the transfer. See \fI\%AcceptDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
You can cancel the transfer before the other account accepts it. See \fI\%CancelDomainTransferToAnotherAwsAccount\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
The other account can reject the transfer. See \fI\%RejectDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount\fP .

\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you transfer a domain from one AWS account to another, Route 53 doesn\(aqt transfer the hosted zone that is associated with the domain. DNS resolution isn\(aqt affected if the domain and the hosted zone are owned by separate accounts, so transferring the hosted zone is optional. For information about transferring the hosted zone to another AWS account, see \fI\%Migrating a Hosted Zone to a Different AWS Account\fP in the \fIAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

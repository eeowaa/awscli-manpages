.SH NAME
sqs-delete-message \- Deletes the specified message from the specified queue
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to delete, use the \fBReceiptHandle\fP of the message (\fInot\fP the \fBMessageId\fP which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBReceiptHandle\fP is associated with a \fIspecific instance\fP of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the \fBReceiptHandle\fP is different each time you receive a message. When you use the \fBDeleteMessage\fP action, you must provide the most recently received \fBReceiptHandle\fP for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message might not be deleted).
.sp
For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

cloudhsmv2-describe-backups \- Gets information about backups of AWS CloudHSM clusters
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gets information about backups of AWS CloudHSM clusters.
.sp
This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the backups. When the response contains only a subset of backups, it includes a \fBNextToken\fP value. Use this value in a subsequent \fBDescribeBackups\fP request to get more backups. When you receive a response with no \fBNextToken\fP (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more backups to get.

\fBdescribe\-backups\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBBackups\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-filters\fP (map)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
One or more filters to limit the items returned in the response.
.sp
Use the \fBbackupIds\fP filter to return only the specified backups. Specify backups by their backup identifier (ID).
.sp
Use the \fBsourceBackupIds\fP filter to return only the backups created from a source backup. The \fBsourceBackupID\fP of a source backup is returned by the  CopyBackupToRegion operation.
.sp
Use the \fBclusterIds\fP filter to return only the backups for the specified clusters. Specify clusters by their cluster identifier (ID).
.sp
Use the \fBstates\fP filter to return only backups that match the specified state.
.sp
Use the \fBneverExpires\fP filter to return backups filtered by the value in the \fBneverExpires\fP parameter. \fBTrue\fP returns all backups exempt from the backup retention policy. \fBFalse\fP returns all backups with a backup retention policy defined at the cluster.

\fB\-\-sort\-ascending\fP | \fB\-\-no\-sort\-ascending\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0

Designates whether or not to sort the return backups by ascending chronological order of generation.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Wait until DBSnapshotNotFound is thrown when polling with \fBdescribe\-db\-snapshots\fP\&. It will poll every 15 seconds until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255 after 40 failed checks.

\fBdb\-snapshot\-completed\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBDBSnapshots\fP

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the DB instance to retrieve the list of DB snapshots for. This parameter can\(aqt be used in conjunction with \fBDBSnapshotIdentifier\fP . This parameter isn\(aqt case\-sensitive.
.sp
Constraints:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

.sp
\fB\-\-snapshot\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBautomated\fP \- Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically taken by Amazon RDS for my AWS account.
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fBshared\fP \- Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to my AWS account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpublic\fP \- Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBawsbackup\fP \- Return the DB snapshots managed by the AWS Backup service. For information about AWS Backup, see the \(ga \fIAWS Backup Developer Guide.\fP \fI\%https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws\-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup\fP\&.html\(ga__   The \fBawsbackup\fP type does not apply to Aurora.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a \fBSnapshotType\fP value, then both automated and manual snapshots are returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are not included in the returned results by default. You can include shared snapshots with these results by enabling the \fBIncludeShared\fP parameter. You can include public snapshots with these results by enabling the \fBIncludePublic\fP parameter.
.sp
The \fBIncludeShared\fP and \fBIncludePublic\fP parameters don\(aqt apply for \fBSnapshotType\fP values of \fBmanual\fP or \fBautomated\fP . The \fBIncludePublic\fP parameter doesn\(aqt apply when \fBSnapshotType\fP is set to \fBshared\fP . The \fBIncludeShared\fP parameter doesn\(aqt apply when \fBSnapshotType\fP is set to \fBpublic\fP .

\fB\-\-include\-shared\fP | \fB\-\-no\-include\-shared\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from other AWS accounts that this AWS account has been given permission to copy or restore. By default, these snapshots are not included.
.sp
You can give an AWS account permission to restore a manual DB snapshot from another AWS account by using the \fBModifyDBSnapshotAttribute\fP API action.

.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates whether to include manual DB cluster snapshots that are public and can be copied or restored by any AWS account. By default, the public snapshots are not included.

You can share a manual DB snapshot as public by using the  ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute API.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

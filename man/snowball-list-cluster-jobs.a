.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns an array of \fBJobListEntry\fP objects of the specified length. Each \fBJobListEntry\fP object is for a job in the specified cluster and contains a job\(aqs state, a job\(aqs ID, and other information.
.sp

\fBlist\-cluster\-jobs\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBJobListEntries\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cluster\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The 39\-character ID for the cluster that you want to list, for example \fBCID123e4567\-e89b\-12d3\-a456\-426655440000\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
JobListEntries \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Each \fBJobListEntry\fP object contains a job\(aqs state, a job\(aqs ID, and a value that indicates whether the job is a job part, in the case of export jobs.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Each \fBJobListEntry\fP object contains a job\(aqs state, a job\(aqs ID, and a value that indicates whether the job is a job part, in the case of an export job.
.sp
JobId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The automatically generated ID for a job, for example \fBJID123e4567\-e89b\-12d3\-a456\-426655440000\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
JobState \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The current state of this job.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
IsMaster \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates that this job is a main job. A main job represents a successful request to create an export job. Main jobs aren\(aqt associated with any Snowballs. Instead, each main job will have at least one job part, and each job part is associated with a Snowball. It might take some time before the job parts associated with a particular main job are listed, because they are created after the main job is created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
JobType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of job.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SnowballType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of device used with this job.
.UNINDENT

.sp
CreationDate \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The creation date for this job.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Description \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The optional description of this specific job, for example \fBImportant Photos 2016\-08\-11\fP .

NextToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
HTTP requests are stateless. If you use the automatically generated \fBNextToken\fP value in your next \fBListClusterJobsResult\fP call, your list of returned jobs will start from this point in the array.

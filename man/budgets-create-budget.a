.INDENT 3.5
The budget object that you want to create.
.sp
BudgetName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
BudgetLimit \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBBudgetLimit\fP is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets default to \fB100\fP , which is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can\(aqt use \fBBudgetLimit\fP with \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP for \fBCreateBudget\fP and \fBUpdateBudget\fP actions.

\fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly and quarterly \fBTimeUnit\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The \fBkey\fP is the start of the month, \fBUTC\fP in epoch seconds.
.sp
For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The \fBkey\fP is the start of the quarter, \fBUTC\fP in epoch seconds.
.sp
If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly, provide the \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP values only for the remaining periods.
.sp
If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP values from the start date of the budget.
.sp
After all of the \fBBudgetLimit\fP values in \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the \fBBudgetLimit\fP . At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBDescribeBudget\fP and \fBDescribeBudgets\fP response along with \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP will also contain \fBBudgetLimit\fP representing the current month or quarter limit present in \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP . This only applies to budgets created with \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP . Budgets created without \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP will only contain \fBBudgetLimit\fP , and no \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP .

If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values.

Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

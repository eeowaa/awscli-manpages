.SH NAME
detective-create-graph \- Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account as the administrator account
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account as the administrator account. This operation is called by the account that is enabling Detective.
.sp
Before you try to enable Detective, make sure that your account has been enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this requirement, you cannot enable Detective. If you do meet the GuardDuty prerequisite, then when you make the request to enable Detective, it checks whether your data volume is within the Detective quota. If it exceeds the quota, then you cannot enable Detective.
.sp
The operation also enables Detective for the calling account in the currently selected Region. It returns the ARN of the new behavior graph.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBCreateGraph\fP triggers a process to create the corresponding data tables for the new behavior graph.

.sp
An account can only be the administrator account for one behavior graph within a Region. If the same account calls \fBCreateGraph\fP with the same administrator account, it always returns the same behavior graph ARN. It does not create a new behavior graph.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo enable Amazon Detective and create a new behavior graph\fP
.sp
The following \fBcreate\-graph\fP example enables Detective for the AWS account that runs the command in the Region where the command is run. A new behavior graph is created that has that account as its administrator account. The command also assigns the value Finance to the Department tag.

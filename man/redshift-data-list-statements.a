\fBlist\-statements\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBStatements\fP

\fB\-\-role\-level\fP | \fB\-\-no\-role\-level\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that filters which statements to return in the response. If true, all statements run by the caller\(aqs IAM role are returned. If false, only statements run by the caller\(aqs IAM role in the current IAM session are returned. The default is true.

\fB\-\-statement\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the SQL statement specified as input to \fBExecuteStatement\fP to identify the query. You can list multiple statements by providing a prefix that matches the beginning of the statement name. For example, to list myStatement1, myStatement2, myStatement3, and so on, then provide the a value of \fBmyStatement\fP . Data API does a case\-sensitive match of SQL statement names to the prefix value you provide.

.sp
\fB\-\-status\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the SQL statement to list. Status values are defined as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ABORTED \- The query run was stopped by the user.
.IP \(bu 2
ALL \- A status value that includes all query statuses. This value can be used to filter results.
.IP \(bu 2
FAILED \- The query run failed.
.IP \(bu 2
FINISHED \- The query has finished running.
.IP \(bu 2
PICKED \- The query has been chosen to be run.
.IP \(bu 2
STARTED \- The query run has started.
.IP \(bu 2
SUBMITTED \- The query was submitted, but not yet processed.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
NextToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates the starting point for the next set of response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this returned NextToken value in the next NextToken parameter and retrying the command. If the NextToken field is empty, all response records have been retrieved for the request.

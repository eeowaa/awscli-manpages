.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the \fBdesiredCount\fP , Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService action.
.sp
In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see \fI\%Service Load Balancing\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
Tasks for services that \fIdo not\fP use a load balancer are considered healthy if they\(aqre in the \fBRUNNING\fP state. Tasks for services that \fIdo\fP use a load balancer are considered healthy if they\(aqre in the \fBRUNNING\fP state and the container instance that they\(aqre hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.
.sp
There are two service scheduler strategies available:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBREPLICA\fP \- The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see \fI\%Service Scheduler Concepts\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDAEMON\fP \- The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don\(aqt need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see \fI\%Service Scheduler Concepts\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an  UpdateService operation. The default value for a replica service for \fBminimumHealthyPercent\fP is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for \fBminimumHealthyPercent\fP is 0%.
.sp
If a service is using the \fBECS\fP deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the \fBRUNNING\fP state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that \fIdo not\fP use a load balancer are considered healthy if they\(aqre in the \fBRUNNING\fP state. Tasks for services that \fIdo\fP use a load balancer are considered healthy if they\(aqre in the \fBRUNNING\fP state and they\(aqre reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.
.sp
If a service is using the \fBECS\fP deployment controller, the \fBmaximum percent\fP parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the \fBRUNNING\fP or \fBPENDING\fP state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.
.sp
If a service is using either the \fBCODE_DEPLOY\fP or \fBEXTERNAL\fP deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the \fBminimum healthy percent\fP and \fBmaximum percent\fP values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the \fBRUNNING\fP state while the container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren\(aqt used, although they\(aqre currently visible when describing your service.
.sp
When creating a service that uses the \fBEXTERNAL\fP deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren\(aqt controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the  CreateTaskSet operation. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon ECS Deployment Types\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service\(aqs task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
.IP \(bu 2
By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the \fBplacementStrategy\fP parameter):
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.
.IP \(bu 2
Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cluster\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to run your service. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-service\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-task\-definition\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBfamily\fP and \fBrevision\fP (\fBfamily:revision\fP ) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a \fBrevision\fP is not specified, the latest \fBACTIVE\fP revision is used.
.sp
A task definition must be specified if the service is using either the \fBECS\fP or \fBCODE_DEPLOY\fP deployment controllers.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-load\-balancers\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your service. For more information, see \fI\%Service Load Balancing\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
If the service is using the rolling update (\fBECS\fP ) deployment controller and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to the service. The service\-linked role is required for services that make use of multiple target groups. For more information, see \fI\%Using service\-linked roles for Amazon ECS\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
If the service is using the \fBCODE_DEPLOY\fP deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a \fBtargetGroupPair\fP ). During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status \fBPRIMARY\fP and associates one target group with it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it.
.sp
After you create a service using the \fBECS\fP deployment controller, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using the \fBCODE_DEPLOY\fP deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service.
.sp
For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. The load balancer name parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group specified here.
.sp
For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. The target group ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer specified here.
.sp
Services with tasks that use the \fBawsvpc\fP network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose \fBip\fP as the target type, not \fBinstance\fP , because tasks that use the \fBawsvpc\fP network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing target group or groups associated with a service or task set.
.sp
A target group ARN is only specified when using an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If you are using a Classic Load Balancer the target group ARN should be omitted.
.sp
For services using the \fBECS\fP deployment controller, you can specify one or multiple target groups. For more information, see \fI\%Registering Multiple Target Groups with a Service\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
For services using the \fBCODE_DEPLOY\fP deployment controller, you are required to define two target groups for the load balancer. For more information, see \fI\%Blue/Green Deployment with CodeDeploy\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If your service\(aqs task definition uses the \fBawsvpc\fP network mode (which is required for the Fargate launch type), you must choose \fBip\fP as the target type, not \fBinstance\fP , when creating your target groups because tasks that use the \fBawsvpc\fP network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy can be set when using the  RunTask or  CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.
.sp
Only capacity providers that are already associated with a cluster and have an \fBACTIVE\fP or \fBUPDATING\fP status can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The  PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.
.sp
If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API operation.
.sp
To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the \fBFARGATE\fP or \fBFARGATE_SPOT\fP capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy.

weight \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fIweight\fP value designates the relative percentage of the total number of tasks launched that should use the specified capacity provider. The \fBweight\fP value is taken into consideration after the \fBbase\fP value, if defined, is satisfied.
.sp
If no \fBweight\fP value is specified, the default value of \fB0\fP is used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the capacity providers must have a weight value greater than zero and any capacity providers with a weight of \fB0\fP will not be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all have a weight of \fB0\fP , any \fBRunTask\fP or \fBCreateService\fP actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.
.sp
An example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of \fB1\fP , then when the \fBbase\fP is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of \fB1\fP for \fIcapacityProviderA\fP and a weight of \fB4\fP for \fIcapacityProviderB\fP , then for every one task that is run using \fIcapacityProviderA\fP , four tasks would use \fIcapacityProviderB\fP .

maximumPercent \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a service is using the rolling update (\fBECS\fP ) deployment type, the \fBmaximum percent\fP parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the \fBRUNNING\fP or \fBPENDING\fP state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.

If a service is using the blue/green (\fBCODE_DEPLOY\fP ) or \fBEXTERNAL\fP deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the \fBmaximum percent\fP value is set to the default value and is used to define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the \fBRUNNING\fP state while the container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state.

minimumHealthyPercent \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a service is using the rolling update (\fBECS\fP ) deployment type, the \fBminimum healthy percent\fP represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the \fBRUNNING\fP state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that \fIdo not\fP use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the \fBRUNNING\fP state; tasks for services that \fIdo\fP use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the \fBRUNNING\fP state and they are reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.

\fB\-\-health\-check\-grace\-period\-seconds\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBREPLICA\fP \-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service is using the \fBCODE_DEPLOY\fP or \fBEXTERNAL\fP deployment controller types.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDAEMON\fP \-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When you\(aqre using this strategy, you don\(aqt need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.

.INDENT 3.5
The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy can be set when using the  RunTask or  CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.
.sp
Only capacity providers that are already associated with a cluster and have an \fBACTIVE\fP or \fBUPDATING\fP status can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The  PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API operation.
.sp
To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the \fBFARGATE\fP or \fBFARGATE_SPOT\fP capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy.

weight \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fIweight\fP value designates the relative percentage of the total number of tasks launched that should use the specified capacity provider. The \fBweight\fP value is taken into consideration after the \fBbase\fP value, if defined, is satisfied.
.sp
If no \fBweight\fP value is specified, the default value of \fB0\fP is used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the capacity providers must have a weight value greater than zero and any capacity providers with a weight of \fB0\fP will not be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all have a weight of \fB0\fP , any \fBRunTask\fP or \fBCreateService\fP actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.
.sp
An example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of \fB1\fP , then when the \fBbase\fP is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of \fB1\fP for \fIcapacityProviderA\fP and a weight of \fB4\fP for \fIcapacityProviderB\fP , then for every one task that is run using \fIcapacityProviderA\fP , four tasks would use \fIcapacityProviderB\fP .

maximumPercent \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a service is using the rolling update (\fBECS\fP ) deployment type, the \fBmaximum percent\fP parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the \fBRUNNING\fP or \fBPENDING\fP state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.
.sp
If a service is using the blue/green (\fBCODE_DEPLOY\fP ) or \fBEXTERNAL\fP deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the \fBmaximum percent\fP value is set to the default value and is used to define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the \fBRUNNING\fP state while the container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the maximum percent value is not used, although it is returned when describing your service.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
minimumHealthyPercent \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a service is using the rolling update (\fBECS\fP ) deployment type, the \fBminimum healthy percent\fP represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the \fBRUNNING\fP state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that \fIdo not\fP use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the \fBRUNNING\fP state; tasks for services that \fIdo\fP use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the \fBRUNNING\fP state and they are reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.
.sp
If a service is using the blue/green (\fBCODE_DEPLOY\fP ) or \fBEXTERNAL\fP deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the \fBminimum healthy percent\fP value is set to the default value and is used to define the lower limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the \fBRUNNING\fP state while the container instances are in the \fBDRAINING\fP state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent value is not used, although it is returned when describing your service.

.INDENT 3.5
The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy can be set when using the  RunTask or  CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.
.sp
Only capacity providers that are already associated with a cluster and have an \fBACTIVE\fP or \fBUPDATING\fP status can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The  PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

.INDENT 3.5
The \fIweight\fP value designates the relative percentage of the total number of tasks launched that should use the specified capacity provider. The \fBweight\fP value is taken into consideration after the \fBbase\fP value, if defined, is satisfied.
.sp
If no \fBweight\fP value is specified, the default value of \fB0\fP is used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the capacity providers must have a weight value greater than zero and any capacity providers with a weight of \fB0\fP will not be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all have a weight of \fB0\fP , any \fBRunTask\fP or \fBCreateService\fP actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.
.sp
An example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of \fB1\fP , then when the \fBbase\fP is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of \fB1\fP for \fIcapacityProviderA\fP and a weight of \fB4\fP for \fIcapacityProviderB\fP , then for every one task that is run using \fIcapacityProviderA\fP , four tasks would use \fIcapacityProviderB\fP .

type \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of constraint. Use \fBdistinctInstance\fP to ensure that each task in a particular group is running on a different container instance. Use \fBmemberOf\fP to restrict the selection to a group of valid candidates.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
expression \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A cluster query language expression to apply to the constraint. You cannot specify an expression if the constraint type is \fBdistinctInstance\fP . For more information, see \fI\%Cluster Query Language\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide\fP .

.sp
type \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of placement strategy. The \fBrandom\fP placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates. The \fBspread\fP placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the \fBfield\fP parameter. The \fBbinpack\fP strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that is specified with the \fBfield\fP parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount of remaining memory (but still enough to run the task).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
field \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The field to apply the placement strategy against. For the \fBspread\fP placement strategy, valid values are \fBinstanceId\fP (or \fBhost\fP , which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as \fBattribute:ecs.availability\-zone\fP . For the \fBbinpack\fP placement strategy, valid values are \fBcpu\fP and \fBmemory\fP . For the \fBrandom\fP placement strategy, this field is not used.

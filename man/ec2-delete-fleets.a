.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified EC2 Fleet.
.sp
After you delete an EC2 Fleet, it launches no new instances.
.sp
You must specify whether a deleted EC2 Fleet should also terminate its instances. If you choose to terminate the instances, the EC2 Fleet enters the \fBdeleted_terminating\fP state. Otherwise, the EC2 Fleet enters the \fBdeleted_running\fP state, and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.
.sp
For \fBinstant\fP fleets, EC2 Fleet must terminate the instances when the fleet is deleted. A deleted \fBinstant\fP fleet with running instances is not supported.

.IP \(bu 2
You can delete up to 25 \fBinstant\fP fleets in a single request. If you exceed this number, no \fBinstant\fP fleets are deleted and an error is returned. There is no restriction on the number of fleets of type \fBmaintain\fP or \fBrequest\fP that can be deleted in a single request.
.IP \(bu 2
Up to 1000 instances can be terminated in a single request to delete \fBinstant\fP fleets.

.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether to terminate the instances when the EC2 Fleet is deleted. The default is to terminate the instances.
.sp
To let the instances continue to run after the EC2 Fleet is deleted, specify \fBNoTerminateInstances\fP . Supported only for fleets of type \fBmaintain\fP and \fBrequest\fP .
.sp
For \fBinstant\fP fleets, you cannot specify \fBNoTerminateInstances\fP . A deleted \fBinstant\fP fleet with running instances is not supported.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

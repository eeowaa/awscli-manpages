.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a Resolver query logging configuration, which defines where you want Resolver to save DNS query logs that originate in your VPCs. Resolver can log queries only for VPCs that are in the same Region as the query logging configuration.
.sp
To specify which VPCs you want to log queries for, you use \fBAssociateResolverQueryLogConfig\fP . For more information, see \fI\%AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig\fP .
.sp
You can optionally use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other AWS accounts. The other accounts can then associate VPCs with the configuration. The query logs that Resolver creates for a configuration include all DNS queries that originate in all VPCs that are associated with the configuration.
.sp

.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name that you want to give the query logging configuration
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-destination\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the resource that you want Resolver to send query logs. You can send query logs to an S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Examples of valid values include the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBS3 bucket\fP :   \fBarn:aws:s3:::examplebucket\fP   You can optionally append a file prefix to the end of the ARN.  \fBarn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/development/\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCloudWatch Logs log group\fP :   \fBarn:aws:logs:us\-west\-1:123456789012:log\-group:/mystack\-testgroup\-12ABC1AB12A1:*\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBKinesis Data Firehose delivery stream\fP :  \fBarn:aws:kinesis:us\-east\-2:0123456789:stream/my_stream_name\fP

\fB\-\-creator\-request\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. \fBCreatorRequestId\fP can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of the tag keys and values that you want to associate with the query logging configuration.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
One tag that you want to add to the specified resource. A tag consists of a \fBKey\fP (a name for the tag) and a \fBValue\fP .
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name for the tag. For example, if you want to associate Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for billing purposes, the value of \fBKey\fP might be \fBaccount\-id\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value for the tag. For example, if \fBKey\fP is \fBaccount\-id\fP , then \fBValue\fP might be the ID of the customer account that you\(aqre creating the resource for.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

s3api-get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \- Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The response describes the new filter element that you can use to specify a filter to select a subset of objects to which the rule applies. If you are using a previous version of the lifecycle configuration, it still works. For the earlier action, see \fI\%GetBucketLifecycle\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket. For information about lifecycle configuration, see \fI\%Object Lifecycle Management\fP .
.sp
To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the \fBs3:GetLifecycleConfiguration\fP action. The bucket owner has this permission, by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see \fI\%Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations\fP and \fI\%Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-bucket\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the bucket for which to get the lifecycle information.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-expected\-bucket\-owner\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP \fB403 (Access Denied)\fP error.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

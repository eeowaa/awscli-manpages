.SH NAME
iam-get-service-linked-role-deletion-status \- Retrieves the status of your service-linked role deletion
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the status of your service\-linked role deletion. After you use  DeleteServiceLinkedRole to submit a service\-linked role for deletion, you can use the \fBDeletionTaskId\fP parameter in \fBGetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus\fP to check the status of the deletion. If the deletion fails, this operation returns the reason that it failed, if that information is returned by the service.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-deletion\-task\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The deletion task identifier. This identifier is returned by the  DeleteServiceLinkedRole operation in the format \fBtask/aws\-service\-role/<service\-principal\-name>/<role\-name>/<task\-uuid>\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBTo check the status of a request to delete a service\-linked role\fP
.sp
The following \fBget\-service\-linked\-role\-deletion\-status\fP example displays the status of a previously request to delete a service\-linked role. The delete operation occurs asynchronously.

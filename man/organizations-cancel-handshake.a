.SH NAME
organizations-cancel-handshake \- Cancels a handshake
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Cancels a handshake. Canceling a handshake sets the handshake state to \fBCANCELED\fP .
.sp
This operation can be called only from the account that originated the handshake. The recipient of the handshake can\(aqt cancel it, but can use  DeclineHandshake instead. After a handshake is canceled, the recipient can no longer respond to that handshake.
.sp
After you cancel a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it\(aqs deleted.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-handshake\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier (ID) of the handshake that you want to cancel. You can get the ID from the  ListHandshakesForOrganization operation.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP for handshake ID string requires "h\-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

State \-> (string)

The current state of the handshake. Use the state to trace the flow of the handshake through the process from its creation to its acceptance. The meaning of each of the valid values is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBREQUESTED\fP : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some handshake types) and not all recipients have responded yet. The request stays in this state until all recipients respond.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOPEN\fP : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some policy types) and all recipients have responded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake action.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCANCELED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because it was canceled by the originating account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACCEPTED\fP : This handshake is complete because it has been accepted by the recipient.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDECLINED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because it was declined by the recipient account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEXPIRED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because the originator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipient before the expiration time (15 days).

The type of handshake, indicating what action occurs when the recipient accepts the handshake. The following handshake types are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINVITE\fP : This type of handshake represents a request to join an organization. It is always sent from the management account to only non\-member accounts.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP : This type of handshake represents a request to enable all features in an organization. It is always sent from the management account to only \fIinvited\fP member accounts. Created accounts do not receive this because those accounts were created by the organization\(aqs management account and approval is inferred.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAPPROVE_ALL_FEATURES\fP : This type of handshake is sent from the Organizations service when all member accounts have approved the \fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP invitation. It is sent only to the management account and signals the master that it can finalize the process to enable all features.

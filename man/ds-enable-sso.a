\fB\-\-user\-name\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The username of an alternate account to use to enable single\-sign on. This is only used for AD Connector directories. This account must have privileges to add a service principal name.
.sp
If the AD Connector service account does not have privileges to add a service principal name, you can specify an alternate account with the \fIUserName\fP and \fIPassword\fP parameters. These credentials are only used to enable single sign\-on and are not stored by the service. The AD Connector service account is not changed.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

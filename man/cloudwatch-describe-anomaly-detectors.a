.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use the token returned by the previous operation to request the next page of results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of results to return in one operation. The maximum value that you can specify is 100.
.sp
To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned \fBNextToken\fP value.

\fB\-\-namespace\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Limits the results to only the anomaly detection models that are associated with the specified namespace.

.sp
\fB\-\-metric\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Limits the results to only the anomaly detection models that are associated with the specified metric name. If there are multiple metrics with this name in different namespaces that have anomaly detection models, they\(aqre all returned.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-dimensions\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Limits the results to only the anomaly detection models that are associated with the specified metric dimensions. If there are multiple metrics that have these dimensions and have anomaly detection models associated, they\(aqre all returned.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric.
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the dimension. Dimension names cannot contain blank spaces or non\-ASCII characters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value of the dimension. Dimension values cannot contain blank spaces or non\-ASCII characters.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.INDENT 3.5
The list of anomaly detection models returned by the operation.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Configuration \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The configuration specifies details about how the anomaly detection model is to be trained, including time ranges to exclude from use for training the model, and the time zone to use for the metric.
.sp
ExcludedTimeRanges \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of time ranges to exclude from use when the anomaly detection model is trained. Use this to make sure that events that could cause unusual values for the metric, such as deployments, aren\(aqt used when CloudWatch creates the model.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
Specifies one range of days or times to exclude from use for training an anomaly detection model.
.sp
StartTime \-> (timestamp)

MetricTimezone \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The time zone to use for the metric. This is useful to enable the model to automatically account for daylight savings time changes if the metric is sensitive to such time changes.
.sp
To specify a time zone, use the name of the time zone as specified in the standard tz database. For more information, see \fI\%tz database\fP .

.SH NAME
globalaccelerator-delete-custom-routing-accelerator \- Delete a custom routing accelerator
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Delete a custom routing accelerator. Before you can delete an accelerator, you must disable it and remove all dependent resources (listeners and endpoint groups). To disable the accelerator, update the accelerator to set \fBEnabled\fP to false.

\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you create a custom routing accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses.
.sp
The IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you \fIdelete\fP an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. As a best practice, ensure that you have permissions in place to avoid inadvertently deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see \fI\%Authentication and Access Control\fP in the \fIAWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

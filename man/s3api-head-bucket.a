.SH NAME
s3api-head-bucket \- This action is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have permission to access it
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This action is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have permission to access it. The action returns a \fB200 OK\fP if the bucket exists and you have permission to access it.
.sp
If the bucket does not exist or you do not have permission to access it, the \fBHEAD\fP request returns a generic \fB404 Not Found\fP or \fB403 Forbidden\fP code. A message body is not included, so you cannot determine the exception beyond these error codes.
.sp
To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the \fBs3:ListBucket\fP action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see \fI\%Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations\fP and \fI\%Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-bucket\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The bucket name.
.sp
When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .s3\-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \fI\%Using access points\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .*outpostID* .s3\-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \fI\%Using S3 on Outposts\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-expected\-bucket\-owner\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP \fB403 (Access Denied)\fP error.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

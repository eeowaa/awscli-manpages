.SH NAME
fms-get-compliance-detail \- Returns detailed compliance information about the specified member account
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns detailed compliance information about the specified member account. Details include resources that are in and out of compliance with the specified policy. Resources are considered noncompliant for AWS WAF and Shield Advanced policies if the specified policy has not been applied to them. Resources are considered noncompliant for security group policies if they are in scope of the policy, they violate one or more of the policy rules, and remediation is disabled or not possible. Resources are considered noncompliant for Network Firewall policies if a firewall is missing in the VPC, if the firewall endpoint isn\(aqt set up in an expected Availability Zone and subnet, if a subnet created by the Firewall Manager doesn\(aqt have the expected route table, and for modifications to a firewall policy that violate the Firewall Manager policy\(aqs rules.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

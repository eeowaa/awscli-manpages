.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
BlockPublicAccessConfiguration \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A configuration for Amazon EMR block public access. The configuration applies to all clusters created in your account for the current Region. The configuration specifies whether block public access is enabled. If block public access is enabled, security groups associated with the cluster cannot have rules that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 on a port, unless the port is specified as an exception using \fBPermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges\fP in the \fBBlockPublicAccessConfiguration\fP . By default, Port 22 (SSH) is an exception, and public access is allowed on this port. You can change this by updating the block public access configuration to remove the exception.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For accounts that created clusters in a Region before November 25, 2019, block public access is disabled by default in that Region. To use this feature, you must manually enable and configure it. For accounts that did not create an EMR cluster in a Region before this date, block public access is enabled by default in that Region.
.UNINDENT

.sp
BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether Amazon EMR block public access is enabled (\fBtrue\fP ) or disabled (\fBfalse\fP ). By default, the value is \fBfalse\fP for accounts that have created EMR clusters before July 2019. For accounts created after this, the default is \fBtrue\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies ports and port ranges that are permitted to have security group rules that allow inbound traffic from all public sources. For example, if Port 23 (Telnet) is specified for \fBPermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges\fP , Amazon EMR allows cluster creation if a security group associated with the cluster has a rule that allows inbound traffic on Port 23 from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 or IPv6 port ::/0 as the source.
.sp
By default, Port 22, which is used for SSH access to the cluster EC2 instances, is in the list of \fBPermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges\fP .
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of port ranges that are permitted to allow inbound traffic from all public IP addresses. To specify a single port, use the same value for \fBMinRange\fP and \fBMaxRange\fP .
.sp
MinRange \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The smallest port number in a specified range of port numbers.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MaxRange \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The smallest port number in a specified range of port numbers.

BlockPublicAccessConfigurationMetadata \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Properties that describe the AWS principal that created the \fBBlockPublicAccessConfiguration\fP using the \fBPutBlockPublicAccessConfiguration\fP action as well as the date and time that the configuration was created. Each time a configuration for block public access is updated, Amazon EMR updates this metadata.
.sp
CreationDateTime \-> (timestamp)

.INDENT 3.5
The date and time that the configuration was created.

.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue names must be unique within each Region. You can use either the queue ID or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-timeout\-in\-seconds\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement changes to a \fBTIMED_OUT\fP status.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-player\-latency\-policies\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A set of policies that act as a sliding cap on player latency. FleetIQ works to deliver low latency for most players in a game session. These policies ensure that no individual player can be placed into a game with unreasonably high latency. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are applied based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value. When updating policies, provide a complete collection of policies.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing a game session. With a latency policy in force, a game session cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are used only with placement request that provide player latency information. Player latency policies can be stacked to gradually relax latency requirements over time.
.sp
Latency policies are part of a  GameSessionQueue .
.sp
MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum latency value that is allowed for any player, in milliseconds. All policies must have a value set for this property.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PolicyDurationSeconds \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

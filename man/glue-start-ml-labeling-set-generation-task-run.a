glue-start-ml-labeling-set-generation-task-run \- Starts the active learning workflow for your machine learning transform to improve the transform(aqs quality by generating label sets and adding labels
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Starts the active learning workflow for your machine learning transform to improve the transform\(aqs quality by generating label sets and adding labels.
.sp
When the \fBStartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun\fP finishes, AWS Glue will have generated a "labeling set" or a set of questions for humans to answer.
.sp
In the case of the \fBFindMatches\fP transform, these questions are of the form, “What is the correct way to group these rows together into groups composed entirely of matching records?”
.sp
After the labeling process is finished, you can upload your labels with a call to \fBStartImportLabelsTaskRun\fP . After \fBStartImportLabelsTaskRun\fP finishes, all future runs of the machine learning transform will use the new and improved labels and perform a higher\-quality transformation.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

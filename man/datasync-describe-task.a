The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task to describe.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Options \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The set of configuration options that control the behavior of a single execution of the task that occurs when you call \fBStartTaskExecution\fP . You can configure these options to preserve metadata such as user ID (UID) and group (GID), file permissions, data integrity verification, and so on.
.sp
For each individual task execution, you can override these options by specifying the overriding \fBOverrideOptions\fP value to \fI\%StartTaskExecution\fP operation.
.sp
VerifyMode \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see \fI\%Configure task settings\fP .
.sp
Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.
.sp
ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred.
.sp
POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn\(aqt supported when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
OverwriteMode \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to \fBNEVER\fP a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes.
.sp
Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed information, see \fI\%Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync\fP in the \fIAWS DataSync User Guide\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
Atime \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you set \fBAtime\fP to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original \fBAtime\fP attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, \fBAtime\fP \(aqs behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best\-effort basis.
.sp

.sp
NONE: Ignore \fBAtime\fP .
.sp

.sp
Mtime \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
PRESERVE: Preserve original \fBMtime\fP (recommended)
.sp
NONE: Ignore \fBMtime\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

PreserveDeletedFiles \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don\(aqt exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see \fI\%Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync\fP in the \fIAWS DataSync User Guide\fP .
.sp
Default value: PRESERVE.

.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AWS DataSync can\(aqt sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don\(aqt return an end\-of\-file (EOF) marker.

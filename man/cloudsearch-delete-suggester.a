.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-domain\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A string that represents the name of a domain. Domain names are unique across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region. Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the following characters: a\-z (lowercase), 0\-9, and \- (hyphen).

\fB\-\-suggester\-name\fP (string)

Specifies the name of the suggester you want to delete.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Suggester \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the suggester being deleted.
.sp
Options \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Configuration information for a search suggester. Each suggester has a unique name and specifies the text field you want to use for suggestions. The following options can be configured for a suggester: \fBFuzzyMatching\fP , \fBSortExpression\fP .
.sp
SuggesterName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Names must begin with a letter and can contain the following characters: a\-z (lowercase), 0\-9, and _ (underscore).
.UNINDENT

.sp
DocumentSuggesterOptions \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Options for a search suggester.
.sp
SourceField \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the index field you want to use for suggestions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
FuzzyMatching \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The level of fuzziness allowed when suggesting matches for a string: \fBnone\fP , \fBlow\fP , or \fBhigh\fP . With none, the specified string is treated as an exact prefix. With low, suggestions must differ from the specified string by no more than one character. With high, suggestions can differ by up to two characters. The default is none.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SortExpression \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An expression that computes a score for each suggestion to control how they are sorted. The scores are rounded to the nearest integer, with a floor of 0 and a ceiling of 2^31\-1. A document\(aqs relevance score is not computed for suggestions, so sort expressions cannot reference the \fB_score\fP value. To sort suggestions using a numeric field or existing expression, simply specify the name of the field or expression. If no expression is configured for the suggester, the suggestions are sorted with the closest matches listed first.

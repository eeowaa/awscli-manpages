s3api-upload-part \- Uploads a part in a multipart upload
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the \fI\%UploadPartCopy\fP operation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You must initiate a multipart upload (see \fI\%CreateMultipartUpload\fP ) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.
.sp
Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.
.sp
To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the \fBContent\-MD5\fP header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.
.sp
If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3 uses the \fBx\-amz\-content\-sha256\fP header as a checksum instead of \fBContent\-MD5\fP . For more information see \fI\%Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version 4)\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBNote:\fP After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.

For more information on multipart uploads, go to \fI\%Multipart Upload Overview\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to \fI\%Multipart Upload and Permissions\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
You can optionally request server\-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using \fI\%CreateMultipartUpload\fP . For more information, go to \fI\%Using Server\-Side Encryption\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
Server\-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer\-provided encryption key, you don\(aqt need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server\-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see \fI\%CreateMultipartUpload\fP .
.sp
If you requested server\-side encryption using a customer\-provided encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following headers.

.sp
\fB\-\-body\fP (blob)
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-bucket\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
.sp
When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .s3\-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \fI\%Using access points\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .*outpostID* .s3\-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \fI\%Using S3 on Outposts\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
The following command uploads the first part in a multipart upload initiated with the \fBcreate\-multipart\-upload\fP command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws s3api upload\-part \-\-bucket my\-bucket \-\-key \(aqmultipart/01\(aq \-\-part\-number 1 \-\-body part01 \-\-upload\-id  "dfRtDYU0WWCCcH43C3WFbkRONycyCpTJJvxu2i5GYkZljF.Yxwh6XG7WfS2vC4to6HiV6Yjlx.cph0gtNBtJ8P3URCSbB7rjxI5iEwVDmgaXZOGgkk5nVTW16HOQ5l0R"

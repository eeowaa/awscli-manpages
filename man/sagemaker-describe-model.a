\fB\-\-model\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the model.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
ModelName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Name of the Amazon SageMaker model.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PrimaryContainer \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The location of the primary inference code, associated artifacts, and custom environment map that the inference code uses when it is deployed in production.
.sp
ContainerHostname \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This parameter is ignored for models that contain only a \fBPrimaryContainer\fP .
.sp
When a \fBContainerDefinition\fP is part of an inference pipeline, the value of the parameter uniquely identifies the container for the purposes of logging and metrics. For information, see \fI\%Use Logs and Metrics to Monitor an Inference Pipeline\fP . If you don\(aqt specify a value for this parameter for a \fBContainerDefinition\fP that is part of an inference pipeline, a unique name is automatically assigned based on the position of the \fBContainerDefinition\fP in the pipeline. If you specify a value for the \fBContainerHostName\fP for any \fBContainerDefinition\fP that is part of an inference pipeline, you must specify a value for the \fBContainerHostName\fP parameter of every \fBContainerDefinition\fP in that pipeline.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Image \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path where inference code is stored. This can be either in Amazon EC2 Container Registry or in a Docker registry that is accessible from the same VPC that you configure for your endpoint. If you are using your own custom algorithm instead of an algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker, the inference code must meet Amazon SageMaker requirements. Amazon SageMaker supports both \fBregistry/repository[:tag]\fP and \fBregistry/repository[@digest]\fP image path formats. For more information, see \fI\%Using Your Own Algorithms with Amazon SageMaker\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Set this to one of the following values:
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
RepositoryAuthConfig \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Specifies an authentication configuration for the private docker registry where your model image is hosted. Specify a value for this property only if you specified \fBVpc\fP as the value for the \fBRepositoryAccessMode\fP field, and the private Docker registry where the model image is hosted requires authentication.
.sp
RepositoryCredentialsProviderArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Lambda function that provides credentials to authenticate to the private Docker registry where your model image is hosted.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ModelDataUrl \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The S3 path where the model artifacts, which result from model training, are stored. This path must point to a single gzip compressed tar archive (.tar.gz suffix). The S3 path is required for Amazon SageMaker built\-in algorithms, but not if you use your own algorithms. For more information on built\-in algorithms, see \fI\%Common Parameters\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The model artifacts must be in an S3 bucket that is in the same region as the model or endpoint you are creating.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you provide a value for this parameter, Amazon SageMaker uses AWS Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provide. AWS STS is activated in your IAM user account by default. If you previously deactivated AWS STS for a region, you need to reactivate AWS STS for that region. For more information, see \fI\%Activating and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region\fP in the \fIAWS Identity and Access Management User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP

.sp
Environment \-> (map)
.INDENT 0.0

MultiModelConfig \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies additional configuration for multi\-model endpoints.
.sp
ModelCacheSetting \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Whether to cache models for a multi\-model endpoint. By default, multi\-model endpoints cache models so that a model does not have to be loaded into memory each time it is invoked. Some use cases do not benefit from model caching. For example, if an endpoint hosts a large number of models that are each invoked infrequently, the endpoint might perform better if you disable model caching. To disable model caching, set the value of this parameter to \fBDisabled\fP .

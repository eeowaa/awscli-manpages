\fB\-\-web\-acl\-lock\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token used for optimistic locking. AWS WAF returns a token to your get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete. AWS WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a \fBWAFOptimisticLockException\fP . If this happens, perform another get, and use the new token returned by that operation.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

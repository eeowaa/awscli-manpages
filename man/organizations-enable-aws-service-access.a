.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Enables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified by \fBServicePrincipal\fP ) with AWS Organizations. When you enable integration, you allow the specified service to create a \fI\%service\-linked role\fP in all the accounts in your organization. This allows the service to perform operations on your behalf in your organization and its accounts.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
We recommend that you enable integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS service by using the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. Doing so ensures that the service is aware that it can create the resources that are required for the integration. How the service creates those resources in the organization\(aqs accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other AWS service.

For more information about enabling services to integrate with AWS Organizations, see \fI\%Integrating AWS Organizations with Other AWS Services\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide.\fP
.sp
This operation can be called only from the organization\(aqs management account and only if the organization has \fI\%enabled all features\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-service\-principal\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The service principal name of the AWS service for which you want to enable integration with your organization. This is typically in the form of a URL, such as \(ga\(ga \fIservice\-abbreviation\fP .amazonaws.com\(ga\(ga .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a placement queue that processes requests for new game sessions. A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session.
.sp
A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (GameLift fleets or aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On\-Demand), instance types, and AWS Regions. If the queue includes multi\-location fleets, the queue is able to place game sessions in all of a fleet\(aqs remote locations. You can opt to filter out individual locations if needed.
.sp
The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first prioritizes the queue\(aqs destinations and locations, with the best placement locations on top. You can set up the queue to use the FleetIQ default prioritization or provide an alternate set of priorities.
.sp
To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, and a list of destinations. Optionally, specify a sort configuration and/or a filter, and define a set of latency cap policies. You can also include the ARN for an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications of game session placement activity. Notifications using SNS or CloudWatch events is the preferred way to track placement activity.
.sp
If successful, a new \fBGameSessionQueue\fP object is returned with an assigned queue ARN. New game session requests, which are submitted to the queue with  StartGameSessionPlacement or  StartMatchmaking , reference a queue\(aqs name or ARN.

\fB\-\-timeout\-in\-seconds\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-player\-latency\-policies\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A set of policies that act as a sliding cap on player latency. FleetIQ works to deliver low latency for most players in a game session. These policies ensure that no individual player can be placed into a game with unreasonably high latency. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are applied based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing a game session. With a latency policy in force, a game session cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are used only with placement request that provide player latency information. Player latency policies can be stacked to gradually relax latency requirements over time.
.sp
Latency policies are part of a  GameSessionQueue .
.sp
MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBExample1: To set up an ordered game session queue\fP
.sp
The following \fBcreate\-game\-session\-queue\fP example creates a new game session queue with destinations in two regions. It also configures the queue so that game session requests time out after waiting 10 minutes for placement. Since no latency policies are defined, GameLift attempts to place all game sessions with the first destination listed.

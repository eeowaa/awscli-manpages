.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBCreateTable\fP operation adds a new table to your account. In an AWS account, table names must be unique within each Region. That is, you can have two tables with same name if you create the tables in different Regions.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBCreateTable\fP is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a \fBCreateTable\fP request, DynamoDB immediately returns a response with a \fBTableStatus\fP of \fBCREATING\fP . After the table is created, DynamoDB sets the \fBTableStatus\fP to \fBACTIVE\fP . You can perform read and write operations only on an \fBACTIVE\fP table.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can optionally define secondary indexes on the new table, as part of the \fBCreateTable\fP operation. If you want to create multiple tables with secondary indexes on them, you must create the tables sequentially. Only one table with secondary indexes can be in the \fBCREATING\fP state at any given time.
.sp
You can use the \fBDescribeTable\fP action to check the table status.

The partition key of an item is also known as its \fIhash attribute\fP . The term "hash attribute" derives from the DynamoDB usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

For a simple primary key (partition key), you must provide exactly one element with a \fBKeyType\fP of \fBHASH\fP .

\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request.

Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

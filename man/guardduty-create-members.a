.SH NAME
guardduty-create-members \- Creates member accounts of the current AWS account by specifying a list of AWS account IDs
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates member accounts of the current AWS account by specifying a list of AWS account IDs. This step is a prerequisite for managing the associated member accounts either by invitation or through an organization.
.sp
When using \fBCreate Members\fP as an organizations delegated administrator this action will enable GuardDuty in the added member accounts, with the exception of the organization delegated administrator account, which must enable GuardDuty prior to being added as a member.
.sp
If you are adding accounts by invitation use this action after GuardDuty has been enabled in potential member accounts and before using \(ga \fBInvite Members\fP \fI\%https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_InviteMembers\fP\&.html\(ga__ .
.sp

See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

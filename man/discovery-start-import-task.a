.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Starts an import task, which allows you to import details of your on\-premises environment directly into AWS Migration Hub without having to use the Application Discovery Service (ADS) tools such as the Discovery Connector or Discovery Agent. This gives you the option to perform migration assessment and planning directly from your imported data, including the ability to group your devices as applications and track their migration status.
.sp
To start an import request, do this:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Download the specially formatted comma separated value (CSV) import template, which you can find here: \fI\%https://s3\-us\-west\-2.amazonaws.com/templates\-7cffcf56\-bd96\-4b1c\-b45b\-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
Fill out the template with your server and application data.
.IP \(bu 2
Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make a note of it\(aqs Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.
.IP \(bu 2
Use the console or the \fBStartImportTask\fP command with the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs to import the records from your file.

There are limits to the number of import tasks you can create (and delete) in an AWS account. For more information, see \fI\%AWS Application Discovery Service Limits\fP in the \fIAWS Application Discovery Service User Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-client\-request\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional. A unique token that you can provide to prevent the same import request from occurring more than once. If you don\(aqt provide a token, a token is automatically generated.
.sp
Sending more than one \fBStartImportTask\fP request with the same client request token will return information about the original import task with that client request token.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A descriptive name for this request. You can use this name to filter future requests related to this import task, such as identifying applications and servers that were included in this import task. We recommend that you use a meaningful name for each import task.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-import\-url\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The URL for your import file that you\(aqve uploaded to Amazon S3.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you\(aqre using the AWS CLI, this URL is structured as follows: \fBs3://BucketName/ImportFileName.CSV\fP

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

A link to a compressed archive folder (in the ZIP format) that contains an error log and a file of failed records. You can use these two files to quickly identify records that failed, why they failed, and correct those records. Afterward, you can upload the corrected file to your Amazon S3 bucket and create another import task request.
.sp
This field also includes authorization information so you can confirm the authenticity of the compressed archive before you download it.
.sp
If some records failed to be imported we recommend that you correct the records in the failed entries file and then imports that failed entries file. This prevents you from having to correct and update the larger original file and attempt importing it again.

.INDENT 3.5
[Service\-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization\(aqs management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you are signed in to the management account, specify \fBSELF\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify \fBDELEGATED_ADMIN\fP . Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see \fI\%Register a delegated administrator\fP in the \fIAWS CloudFormation User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
Action \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of stack set operation: \fBCREATE\fP , \fBUPDATE\fP , or \fBDELETE\fP .

.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the operation.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP : The operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance. The failure tolerance value that you\(aqve set for an operation is applied for each Region during stack create and update operations. If the number of failed stacks within a Region exceeds the failure tolerance, the status of the operation in the Region is set to \fBFAILED\fP . This in turn sets the status of the operation as a whole to \fBFAILED\fP , and AWS CloudFormation cancels the operation in any remaining Regions.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBQUEUED\fP : [Service\-managed permissions] For automatic deployments that require a sequence of operations, the operation is queued to be performed. For more information, see the \fI\%stack set operation status codes\fP in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRUNNING\fP : The operation is currently being performed.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSTOPPED\fP : The user has cancelled the operation.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSTOPPING\fP : The operation is in the process of stopping, at user request.

.UNINDENT
.sp
FailureToleranceCount \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn\(aqt attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.
.sp
Conditional: You must specify either \fBFailureToleranceCount\fP or \fBFailureTolerancePercentage\fP (but not both).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
FailureTolerancePercentage \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, AWS CloudFormation doesn\(aqt attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.
.sp
When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds \fIdown\fP to the next whole number.
.sp
Conditional: You must specify either \fBFailureToleranceCount\fP or \fBFailureTolerancePercentage\fP , but not both.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MaxConcurrentCount \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This is dependent on the value of \fBFailureToleranceCount\fP . \fBMaxConcurrentCount\fP is at most one more than the \fBFailureToleranceCount\fP .
.sp
Note that this setting lets you specify the \fImaximum\fP for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.
.sp
Conditional: You must specify either \fBMaxConcurrentCount\fP or \fBMaxConcurrentPercentage\fP , but not both.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MaxConcurrentPercentage \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time.
.sp
When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, AWS CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.
.sp
Note that this setting lets you specify the \fImaximum\fP for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

CreationTimestamp \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the creation times for the stack set operation might differ from the creation time of the individual stacks themselves. This is because AWS CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work for the operation, such as dispatching the work to the requested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EndTimestamp \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0

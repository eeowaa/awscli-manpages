.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(AudioDescriptions) contains groups of audio encoding settings organized by audio codec. Include one instance of (AudioDescriptions) per output. (AudioDescriptions) can contain multiple groups of encoding settings.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Settings related to one audio tab on the MediaConvert console. In your job JSON, an instance of AudioDescription is equivalent to one audio tab in the console. Usually, one audio tab corresponds to one output audio track. Depending on how you set up your input audio selectors and whether you use audio selector groups, one audio tab can correspond to a group of output audio tracks.
.sp
AudioChannelTaggingSettings \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you mimic a multi\-channel audio layout with multiple mono\-channel tracks, you can tag each channel layout manually. For example, you would tag the tracks that contain your left, right, and center audio with Left (L), Right (R), and Center (C), respectively. When you don\(aqt specify a value, MediaConvert labels your track as Center (C) by default. To use audio layout tagging, your output must be in a QuickTime (.mov) container; your audio codec must be AAC, WAV, or AIFF; and you must set up your audio track to have only one channel.
.sp
ChannelTag \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You can add a tag for this mono\-channel audio track to mimic its placement in a multi\-channel layout. For example, if this track is the left surround channel, choose Left surround (LS).

.sp
Algorithm \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Choose one of the following audio normalization algorithms: ITU\-R BS.1770\-1: Ungated loudness. A measurement of ungated average loudness for an entire piece of content, suitable for measurement of short\-form content under ATSC recommendation A/85. Supports up to 5.1 audio channels. ITU\-R BS.1770\-2: Gated loudness. A measurement of gated average loudness compliant with the requirements of EBU\-R128. Supports up to 5.1 audio channels. ITU\-R BS.1770\-3: Modified peak. The same loudness measurement algorithm as 1770\-2, with an updated true peak measurement. ITU\-R BS.1770\-4: Higher channel count. Allows for more audio channels than the other algorithms, including configurations such as 7.1.
.UNINDENT

.sp
AudioSourceName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies which audio data to use from each input. In the simplest case, specify an "Audio Selector":#inputs\-audio_selector by name based on its order within each input. For example if you specify "Audio Selector 3", then the third audio selector will be used from each input. If an input does not have an "Audio Selector 3", then the audio selector marked as "default" in that input will be used. If there is no audio selector marked as "default", silence will be inserted for the duration of that input. Alternatively, an "Audio Selector Group":#inputs\-audio_selector_group name may be specified, with similar default/silence behavior. If no audio_source_name is specified, then "Audio Selector 1" will be chosen automatically.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AudioType \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
CodecSettings \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Settings related to audio encoding. The settings in this group vary depending on the value that you choose for your audio codec.
.sp
AacSettings \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Required when you set (Codec) under (AudioDescriptions)>(CodecSettings) to the value AAC. The service accepts one of two mutually exclusive groups of AAC settings\-\-VBR and CBR. To select one of these modes, set the value of Bitrate control mode (rateControlMode) to "VBR" or "CBR". In VBR mode, you control the audio quality with the setting VBR quality (vbrQuality). In CBR mode, you use the setting Bitrate (bitrate). Defaults and valid values depend on the rate control mode.
.sp
AudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD when the input contains pre\-mixed main audio + audio description (AD) as a stereo pair. The value for AudioType will be set to 3, which signals to downstream systems that this stream contains "broadcaster mixed AD". Note that the input received by the encoder must contain pre\-mixed audio; the encoder does not perform the mixing. When you choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD, the encoder ignores any values you provide in AudioType and FollowInputAudioType. Choose NORMAL when the input does not contain pre\-mixed audio + audio description (AD). In this case, the encoder will use any values you provide for AudioType and FollowInputAudioType.

For this situation, choose Match video duration (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION). In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION). When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert pads the output audio streams with silence or trims them to ensure that the total duration of each audio stream is at least as long as the total duration of the video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file.

For example, say you want to include the audio rendition groups that have the audio group IDs "audio_aac_1" and "audio_dolby". Then you would specify this value: "audio_aac_1, audio_dolby". Related setting: The rendition groups that you include in your comma\-separated list should all match values that you specify in the setting Audio group ID (AudioGroupId) for audio renditions in the same output group as this video rendition. Default behavior: If you don\(aqt specify anything here and for Audio group ID, MediaConvert puts each audio variant in its own audio rendition group and associates it with every video variant. Each value in your list appears in your HLS parent manifest in the EXT\-X\-STREAM\-INF tag as the value for the AUDIO attribute. To continue the previous example, say that the file name for the child manifest for your video rendition is "amazing_video_1.m3u8". Then, in your parent manifest, each value will appear on separate lines, like this: #EXT\-X\-STREAM\-INF:AUDIO="audio_aac_1"... amazing_video_1.m3u8 #EXT\-X\-STREAM\-INF:AUDIO="audio_dolby"... amazing_video_1.m3u8

SegmentationStyle \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The segmentation style parameter controls how segmentation markers are inserted into the transport stream. With avails, it is possible that segments may be truncated, which can influence where future segmentation markers are inserted. When a segmentation style of "reset_cadence" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will have a duration of of $segmentation_time seconds. When a segmentation style of "maintain_cadence" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will not reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will likely be truncated as well. However, all segments after that will have a duration of $segmentation_time seconds. Note that EBP lookahead is a slight exception to this rule.

For this situation, choose Match video duration (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION). In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION). When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert pads the output audio streams with silence or trims them to ensure that the total duration of each audio stream is at least as long as the total duration of the video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file.

Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to use when increasing or decreasing the frame rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP) for numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion\-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add\-on cost.

Use higher numbers for greater quality. Level 10 results in nearly lossless compression. The quality level for most broadcast\-quality transcodes is between 6 and 9. Optionally, to specify a value between whole numbers, also provide a value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFineTune. For example, if you want your QVBR quality level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33.

SpatialAdaptiveQuantization \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\(aqt take into account where the viewer\(aqs attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the value for Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization) depending on your content. For homogeneous content, such as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For content with a wider variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.

For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion\-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add\-on cost.

Use Follow, default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same field polarity as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the output field polarity might change over the course of the output. Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If the source is interlaced, the output will be interlaced with the same polarity as the source. If the source is progressive, the output will be interlaced with top field bottom field first, depending on which of the Follow options you choose.

.INDENT 3.5
Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn\(aqt suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can\(aqt use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).

Ignore this setting unless your input frame rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling this setting will slightly reduce the duration of your video. Required settings: You must also set Framerate to 25.

When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization is Disabled (DISABLED). Change this value to Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce I\-frame pop. I\-frame pop appears as a visual flicker that can arise when the encoder saves bits by copying some macroblocks many times from frame to frame, and then refreshes them at the I\-frame. When you enable this setting, the encoder updates these macroblocks slightly more often to smooth out the flicker.

Ignore this setting unless your input frame rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling this setting will slightly reduce the duration of your video. Required settings: You must also set Framerate to 25.

Softness \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Ignore this setting unless you need to comply with a specification that requires a specific value. If you don\(aqt have a specification requirement, we recommend that you adjust the softness of your output by using a lower value for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or by enabling a noise reducer filter (noiseReducerFilter). The Softness (softness) setting specifies the quantization matrices that the encoder uses. Keep the default value, 0, for flat quantization. Choose the value 1 or 16 to use the default JVT softening quantization matricies from the H.264 specification. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar interpolation. Increasing values from 17 to 128 result in increasing reduction of high\-frequency data. The value 128 results in the softest video.

SpatialAdaptiveQuantization \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Only use this setting when you change the default value, Auto (AUTO), for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization. When you keep all defaults, excluding H264AdaptiveQuantization and all other adaptive quantization from your JSON job specification, MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of quantization for your video content. When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization is Enabled (ENABLED). Keep this default value to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\(aqt take into account where the viewer\(aqs attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to set H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization to Disabled (DISABLED). Related setting: When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the value for Adaptive quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) depending on your content. For homogeneous content, such as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For content with a wider variety of textures, set it to High or Higher. To manually enable or disable H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization, you must set Adaptive quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) to a value other than AUTO.

When you do frame rate conversion from 23.976 frames per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally enable hard or soft telecine to create a smoother picture. Hard telecine (HARD) produces a 29.97i output. Soft telecine (SOFT) produces an output with a 23.976 output that signals to the video player device to do the conversion during play back. When you keep the default value, None (NONE), MediaConvert does a standard frame rate conversion to 29.97 without doing anything with the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization is Enabled (ENABLED). Keep this default value to adjust quantization within each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that aren\(aqt moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that move a lot. For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality.

.INDENT 3.5
Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to use when increasing or decreasing the frame rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP) for numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion\-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add\-on cost.

In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn\(aqt suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can\(aqt use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to use when increasing or decreasing the frame rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP) for numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion\-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add\-on cost.

.INDENT 3.5
Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn\(aqt suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can\(aqt use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).

Ignore this setting unless your input frame rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling this setting will slightly reduce the duration of your video. Required settings: You must also set Framerate to 25. In your JSON job specification, set (framerateControl) to (SPECIFIED), (framerateNumerator) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to 1.

Ignore this setting unless you need to comply with a specification that requires a specific value. If you don\(aqt have a specification requirement, we recommend that you adjust the softness of your output by using a lower value for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or by enabling a noise reducer filter (noiseReducerFilter). The Softness (softness) setting specifies the quantization matrices that the encoder uses. Keep the default value, 0, to use the AWS Elemental default matrices. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar interpolation. Increasing values from 17 to 128 result in increasing reduction of high\-frequency data. The value 128 results in the softest video.

SpatialAdaptiveQuantization \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\(aqt take into account where the viewer\(aqs attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the value for Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization) depending on your content. For homogeneous content, such as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For content with a wider variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.

When you do frame rate conversion from 23.976 frames per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally enable hard or soft telecine to create a smoother picture. Hard telecine (HARD) produces a 29.97i output. Soft telecine (SOFT) produces an output with a 23.976 output that signals to the video player device to do the conversion during play back. When you keep the default value, None (NONE), MediaConvert does a standard frame rate conversion to 29.97 without doing anything with the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

TemporalAdaptiveQuantization \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that aren\(aqt moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that move a lot. For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\(aqt take into account where the viewer\(aqs attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn\(aqt have moving objects with sharp edges, such as sports athletes\(aq faces, you might choose to disable this feature.

FramerateConversionAlgorithm \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to use when increasing or decreasing the frame rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP) for numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion\-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add\-on cost.

PostTemporalSharpening \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional. When you set Noise reducer (noiseReducer) to Temporal (TEMPORAL), you can use this setting to apply sharpening. The default behavior, Auto (AUTO), allows the transcoder to determine whether to apply filtering, depending on input type and quality. When you set Noise reducer to Temporal, your output bandwidth is reduced. When Post temporal sharpening is also enabled, that bandwidth reduction is smaller.
.UNINDENT

Payload \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specify the payload ID that you want associated with this output. Valid values vary depending on your Nagra NexGuard forensic watermarking workflow. Required when you include Nagra NexGuard File Marker watermarking (NexGuardWatermarkingSettings) in your job. For PreRelease Content (NGPR/G2), specify an integer from 1 through 4,194,303. You must generate a unique ID for each asset you watermark, and keep a record of which ID you have assigned to each asset. Neither Nagra nor MediaConvert keep track of the relationship between output files and your IDs. For OTT Streaming, create two adaptive bitrate (ABR) stacks for each asset. Do this by setting up two output groups. For one output group, set the value of Payload ID (payload) to 0 in every output. For the other output group, set Payload ID (payload) to 1 in every output.

SegmentationStyle \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The segmentation style parameter controls how segmentation markers are inserted into the transport stream. With avails, it is possible that segments may be truncated, which can influence where future segmentation markers are inserted. When a segmentation style of "reset_cadence" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will have a duration of of $segmentation_time seconds. When a segmentation style of "maintain_cadence" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will not reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will likely be truncated as well. However, all segments after that will have a duration of $segmentation_time seconds. Note that EBP lookahead is a slight exception to this rule.

For this situation, choose Match video duration (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION). In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION). When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert pads the output audio streams with silence or trims them to ensure that the total duration of each audio stream is at least as long as the total duration of the video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file.

For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion\-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add\-on cost.

SpatialAdaptiveQuantization \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\(aqt take into account where the viewer\(aqs attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the value for Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization) depending on your content.

Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn\(aqt suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can\(aqt use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs.

Ignore this setting unless your input frame rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling this setting will slightly reduce the duration of your video. Required settings: You must also set Framerate to 25.

.INDENT 3.5
Ignore this setting unless you need to comply with a specification that requires a specific value. If you don\(aqt have a specification requirement, we recommend that you adjust the softness of your output by using a lower value for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or by enabling a noise reducer filter (noiseReducerFilter). The Softness (softness) setting specifies the quantization matrices that the encoder uses. Keep the default value, 0, for flat quantization. Choose the value 1 or 16 to use the default JVT softening quantization matricies from the H.264 specification. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar interpolation. Increasing values from 17 to 128 result in increasing reduction of high\-frequency data. The value 128 results in the softest video.

SpatialAdaptiveQuantization \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
Only use this setting when you change the default value, Auto (AUTO), for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization. When you keep all defaults, excluding H264AdaptiveQuantization and all other adaptive quantization from your JSON job specification, MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of quantization for your video content. When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization is Enabled (ENABLED). Keep this default value to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\(aqt take into account where the viewer\(aqs attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to set H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization to Disabled (DISABLED). Related setting: When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the value for Adaptive quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) depending on your content. For homogeneous content, such as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For content with a wider variety of textures, set it to High or Higher. To manually enable or disable H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization, you must set Adaptive quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) to a value other than AUTO.

When you do frame rate conversion from 23.976 frames per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally enable hard or soft telecine to create a smoother picture. Hard telecine (HARD) produces a 29.97i output. Soft telecine (SOFT) produces an output with a 23.976 output that signals to the video player device to do the conversion during play back. When you keep the default value, None (NONE), MediaConvert does a standard frame rate conversion to 29.97 without doing anything with the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

Only use this setting when you change the default value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization. When you keep all defaults, excluding H264AdaptiveQuantization and all other adaptive quantization from your JSON job specification, MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of quantization for your video content. When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization is Enabled (ENABLED). Keep this default value to adjust quantization within each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that aren\(aqt moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that move a lot. For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\(aqt take into account where the viewer\(aqs attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn\(aqt have moving objects with sharp edges, such as sports athletes\(aq faces, you might choose to set H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization to Disabled (DISABLED). Related setting: When you enable temporal quantization, adjust the strength of the filter with the setting Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization).

Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to use when increasing or decreasing the frame rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP) for numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion\-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add\-on cost.

TemporalAdaptiveQuantization \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that aren\(aqt moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that move a lot. For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\(aqt take into account where the viewer\(aqs attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn\(aqt have moving objects with sharp edges, such as sports athletes\(aq faces, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable temporal quantization, adjust the strength of the filter with the setting Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization).

Enables temporal layer identifiers in the encoded bitstream. Up to 3 layers are supported depending on GOP structure: I\- and P\-frames form one layer, reference B\-frames can form a second layer and non\-reference b\-frames can form a third layer. Decoders can optionally decode only the lower temporal layers to generate a lower frame rate output. For example, given a bitstream with temporal IDs and with b\-frames = 1 (i.e. IbPbPb display order), a decoder could decode all the frames for full frame rate output or only the I and P frames (lowest temporal layer) for a half frame rate output.

If the location of parameter set NAL units doesn\(aqt matter in your workflow, ignore this setting. Use this setting only with CMAF or DASH outputs, or with standalone file outputs in an MPEG\-4 container (MP4 outputs). Choose HVC1 to mark your output as HVC1. This makes your output compliant with the following specification: ISO IECJTC1 SC29 N13798 Text ISO/IEC FDIS 14496\-15 3rd Edition. For these outputs, the service stores parameter set NAL units in the sample headers but not in the samples directly. For MP4 outputs, when you choose HVC1, your output video might not work properly with some downstream systems and video players. The service defaults to marking your output as HEV1.

For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion\-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add\-on cost.

In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn\(aqt suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can\(aqt use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs.

The Softness (softness) setting specifies the quantization matrices that the encoder uses. Keep the default value, 0, to use the AWS Elemental default matrices. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar interpolation. Increasing values from 17 to 128 result in increasing reduction of high\-frequency data. The value 128 results in the softest video.

Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\(aqt take into account where the viewer\(aqs attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to disable this feature.

ScanTypeConversionMode \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn\(aqt suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can\(aqt use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).

For example, say that your video resolution is 1920x1080 and your framerate is 29.97. Then Class 145 (CLASS_145) gives you an output with a bitrate of approximately 145 Mbps and Class 220 (CLASS_220) gives you and output with a bitrate of approximately 220 Mbps. VC3 class also specifies the color bit depth of your output.

For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion\-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add\-on cost.

When set to NORMAL (default), the deinterlacer does not convert frames that are tagged in metadata as progressive. It will only convert those that are tagged as some other type. \- When set to FORCE_ALL_FRAMES, the deinterlacer converts every frame to progressive \- even those that are already tagged as progressive. Turn Force mode on only if there is a good chance that the metadata has tagged frames as progressive when they are not progressive. Do not turn on otherwise; processing frames that are already progressive into progressive will probably result in lower quality video.

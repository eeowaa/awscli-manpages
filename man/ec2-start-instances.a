.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Starts an Amazon EBS\-backed instance that you\(aqve previously stopped.
.sp
Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you are not billed for instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60\-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one\-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.
.sp
Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.
.sp
Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its root device returns an error.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Stopping instances\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 User Guide\fP .

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \fBDryRunOperation\fP . Otherwise, it is \fBUnauthorizedOperation\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
StartingInstances \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Information about the started instances.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Describes an instance state change.
.sp
CurrentState \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The current state of the instance.
.sp
Code \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The state of the instance as a 16\-bit unsigned integer.
.sp
The high byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and (2^16)\-1, which equals decimal values between 256 and 65,535. These numerical values are used for internal purposes and should be ignored.
.sp
The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)\-1, which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.
.sp
The valid values for instance\-state\-code will all be in the range of the low byte and they are:
.INDENT 0.0

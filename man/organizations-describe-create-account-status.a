.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-create\-account\-request\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the \fBId\fP value that uniquely identifies the \fBCreateAccount\fP request. You can get the value from the \fBCreateAccountStatus.Id\fP response in an earlier  CreateAccount request, or from the  ListCreateAccountStatus operation.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP for a create account request ID string requires "car\-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo get the latest status about a request to create an account\fP
.sp
The following example shows how to request the latest status for a previous request to create an account in an organization. The specified \-\-request\-id comes from the response of the original call to create\-account. The account creation request shows by the status field that Organizations successfully completed the creation of the account.

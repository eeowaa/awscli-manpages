.sp
If you\(aqre registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to a Route 53 health check.

.UNINDENT
.sp
You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone. Note the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC.
.IP \(bu 2
You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.
.IP \(bu 2
You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 \fBStatusCheckFailed\fP metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the \fI\%Amazon CloudWatch User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-caller\-reference\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique string that identifies the request and that allows you to retry a failed \fBCreateHealthCheck\fP request without the risk of creating two identical health checks:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you send a \fBCreateHealthCheck\fP request with the same \fBCallerReference\fP and settings as a previous request, and if the health check doesn\(aqt exist, Amazon Route 53 creates the health check. If the health check does exist, Route 53 returns the settings for the existing health check.
.IP \(bu 2
If you send a \fBCreateHealthCheck\fP request with the same \fBCallerReference\fP as a deleted health check, regardless of the settings, Route 53 returns a \fBHealthCheckAlreadyExists\fP error.
.IP \(bu 2
If you send a \fBCreateHealthCheck\fP request with the same \fBCallerReference\fP as an existing health check but with different settings, Route 53 returns a \fBHealthCheckAlreadyExists\fP error.
.IP \(bu 2
If you send a \fBCreateHealthCheck\fP request with a unique \fBCallerReference\fP but settings identical to an existing health check, Route 53 creates the health check.

\fB\-\-health\-check\-config\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A complex type that contains settings for a new health check.
.sp
IPAddress \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don\(aqt specify a value for \fBIPAddress\fP , Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP at the interval that you specify in \fBRequestInterval\fP . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
.sp
Use one of the following formats for the value of \fBIPAddress\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIPv4 address\fP : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, \fB192.0.2.44\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIPv6 address\fP : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, \fB2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345\fP . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, \fB2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for \fBIPAddress\fP . This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%FullyQualifiedDomainName\fP .
.sp
Constraints: Route 53 can\(aqt check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in local, private, non\-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can\(aqt create health checks, see the following documents:

You can create the following types of health checks:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBHTTP\fP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBHTTPS\fP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBHTTP_STR_MATCH\fP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in \fBSearchString\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBHTTPS_STR_MATCH\fP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an \fBHTTPS\fP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in \fBSearchString\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBTCP\fP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCLOUDWATCH_METRIC\fP : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm is \fBOK\fP , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is \fBALARM\fP , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn\(aqt have sufficient data to determine whether the state is \fBOK\fP or \fBALARM\fP , the health check status depends on the setting for \fBInsufficientDataHealthStatus\fP : \fBHealthy\fP , \fBUnhealthy\fP , or \fBLastKnownStatus\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCALCULATED\fP : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and compares that number with the value of \fBHealthThreshold\fP .

ResourcePath \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53\-health\-check.html. You can also include query string parameters, for example, \fB/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
FullyQualifiedDomainName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for \fBIPAddress\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBIf you specify a value for\fP  \fBIPAddress\fP :
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP in the \fBHost\fP header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.
.sp
When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the \fBHost\fP header:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you specify a value of \fB80\fP for \fBPort\fP and \fBHTTP\fP or \fBHTTP_STR_MATCH\fP for \fBType\fP , Route 53 passes the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP to the endpoint in the Host header.
.IP \(bu 2
If you specify a value of \fB443\fP for \fBPort\fP and \fBHTTPS\fP or \fBHTTPS_STR_MATCH\fP for \fBType\fP , Route 53 passes the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP to the endpoint in the \fBHost\fP header.
.IP \(bu 2
If you specify another value for \fBPort\fP and any value except \fBTCP\fP for \fBType\fP , Route 53 passes \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName:Port\fP to the endpoint in the \fBHost\fP header.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a value for \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , Route 53 substitutes the value of \fBIPAddress\fP in the \fBHost\fP header in each of the preceding cases.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP at the interval that you specify for \fBRequestInterval\fP . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you don\(aqt specify a value for \fBIPAddress\fP , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there\(aqs no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , specify the domain name of the server (such as us\-east\-2\-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition, if the value that you specify for \fBType\fP is \fBHTTP\fP , \fBHTTPS\fP , \fBHTTP_STR_MATCH\fP , or \fBHTTPS_STR_MATCH\fP , Route 53 passes the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP in the \fBHost\fP header, as it does when you specify a value for \fBIPAddress\fP . If the value of \fBType\fP is \fBTCP\fP , Route 53 doesn\(aqt pass a \fBHost\fP header.

SearchString \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the value of Type is \fBHTTP_STR_MATCH\fP or \fBHTTPS_STR_MATCH\fP , the string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

Route 53 considers case when searching for \fBSearchString\fP in the response body.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
RequestInterval \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health checker makes requests at this interval.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see \fI\%How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy\fP in the \fIAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide\fP .

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here\(aqs what happens:

.IP \(bu 2
\fBHealth checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:\fP Route 53 stops monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.
.UNINDENT
.sp
After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the value of \fI\%Inverted\fP .
.sp
Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon Route 53 Pricing\fP .

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of child health checks that are associated with a \fBCALCULATED\fP health check that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the \fBCALCULATED\fP health check to be considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a \fBCALCULATED\fP health check, use the \fI\%ChildHealthChecks\fP element.

EnableSNI \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP to the endpoint in the \fBclient_hello\fP message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond to \fBHTTPS\fP health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.
.sp
Some endpoints require that \fBHTTPS\fP requests include the host name in the \fBclient_hello\fP message. If you don\(aqt enable SNI, the status of the health check will be \fBSSL alert handshake_failure\fP . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you\(aqre still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.
.sp
The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the \fBCommon Name\fP field and possibly several more in the \fBSubject Alternative Names\fP field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP . If the endpoint responds to the \fBclient_hello\fP message with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP from the \fBclient_hello\fP message.

.sp
Regions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A complex type that contains one \fBRegion\fP element for each region from which you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks from all of the regions that are listed under \fBValid Values\fP .
.sp
If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks, Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with four different regions).

.INDENT 3.5
The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don\(aqt specify a value for \fBIPAddress\fP , Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP at the interval that you specify in \fBRequestInterval\fP . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
.sp
Use one of the following formats for the value of \fBIPAddress\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIPv4 address\fP : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, \fB192.0.2.44\fP .

Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP in the \fBHost\fP header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.
.sp
When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the \fBHost\fP header:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you specify a value of \fB80\fP for \fBPort\fP and \fBHTTP\fP or \fBHTTP_STR_MATCH\fP for \fBType\fP , Route 53 passes the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP to the endpoint in the Host header.
.IP \(bu 2
If you specify a value of \fB443\fP for \fBPort\fP and \fBHTTPS\fP or \fBHTTPS_STR_MATCH\fP for \fBType\fP , Route 53 passes the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP to the endpoint in the \fBHost\fP header.
.IP \(bu 2
If you specify another value for \fBPort\fP and any value except \fBTCP\fP for \fBType\fP , Route 53 passes \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName:Port\fP to the endpoint in the \fBHost\fP header.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a value for \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , Route 53 substitutes the value of \fBIPAddress\fP in the \fBHost\fP header in each of the preceding cases.

.sp
Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP at the interval that you specify for \fBRequestInterval\fP . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
.sp

If you don\(aqt specify a value for \fBIPAddress\fP , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there\(aqs no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , specify the domain name of the server (such as us\-east\-2\-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition, if the value that you specify for \fBType\fP is \fBHTTP\fP , \fBHTTPS\fP , \fBHTTP_STR_MATCH\fP , or \fBHTTPS_STR_MATCH\fP , Route 53 passes the value of \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP in the \fBHost\fP header, as it does when you specify a value for \fBIPAddress\fP .

Some endpoints require that \fBHTTPS\fP requests include the host name in the \fBclient_hello\fP message.

The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the \fBCommon Name\fP field and possibly several more in the \fBSubject Alternative Names\fP field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP . If the endpoint responds to the \fBclient_hello\fP message with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in \fBFullyQualifiedDomainName\fP , a health checker will retry the handshake.

.SH NAME
datapipeline-delete-pipeline \- Deletes a pipeline, its pipeline definition, and its run history
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a pipeline, its pipeline definition, and its run history. AWS Data Pipeline attempts to cancel instances associated with the pipeline that are currently being processed by task runners.
.sp
Deleting a pipeline cannot be undone. You cannot query or restore a deleted pipeline. To temporarily pause a pipeline instead of deleting it, call  SetStatus with the status set to \fBPAUSE\fP on individual components. Components that are paused by  SetStatus can be resumed.
.sp

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
globalaccelerator-withdraw-byoip-cidr \- Stops advertising an address range that is provisioned as an address pool
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Stops advertising an address range that is provisioned as an address pool. You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time.
.sp
It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses stops routing to AWS because of propagation delays.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)\fP in the \fIAWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

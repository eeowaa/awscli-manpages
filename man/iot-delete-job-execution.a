.sp
\fB\-\-job\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the job whose execution on a particular device will be deleted.

\fB\-\-thing\-name\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-execution\-number\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the job execution to be deleted. The \fBexecutionNumber\fP refers to the execution of a particular job on a particular device.
.sp
Note that once a job execution is deleted, the \fBexecutionNumber\fP may be reused by IoT, so be sure you get and use the correct value here.

\fB\-\-force\fP | \fB\-\-no\-force\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) When true, you can delete a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS". Otherwise, you can only delete a job execution which is in a terminal state ("SUCCEEDED", "FAILED", "REJECTED", "REMOVED" or "CANCELED") or an exception will occur. The default is false.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Deleting a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause the device to be unable to access job information or update the job execution status. Use caution and ensure that the device is able to recover to a valid state.

\fB\-\-namespace\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer\-managed job.
.sp
When you specify a value for this parameter, AWS IoT Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the value in the following format.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

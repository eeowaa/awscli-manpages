.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

AlgorithmSpecification \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Information about the algorithm used for training, and algorithm metadata.
.sp
TrainingImage \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The registry path of the Docker image that contains the training algorithm. For information about docker registry paths for built\-in algorithms, see \fI\%Algorithms Provided by Amazon SageMaker: Common Parameters\fP . Amazon SageMaker supports both \fBregistry/repository[:tag]\fP and \fBregistry/repository[@digest]\fP image path formats. For more information, see \fI\%Using Your Own Algorithms with Amazon SageMaker\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AlgorithmName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the algorithm resource to use for the training job. This must be an algorithm resource that you created or subscribe to on AWS Marketplace. If you specify a value for this parameter, you can\(aqt specify a value for \fBTrainingImage\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
TrainingInputMode \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The input mode that the algorithm supports. For the input modes that Amazon SageMaker algorithms support, see \fI\%Algorithms\fP . If an algorithm supports the \fBFile\fP input mode, Amazon SageMaker downloads the training data from S3 to the provisioned ML storage Volume, and mounts the directory to docker volume for training container. If an algorithm supports the \fBPipe\fP input mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly from S3 to the container.
.sp
In File mode, make sure you provision ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to accommodate the data download from S3. In addition to the training data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The algorithm container use ML storage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.
.sp
For distributed algorithms using File mode, training data is distributed uniformly, and your training duration is predictable if the input data objects size is approximately same. Amazon SageMaker does not split the files any further for model training. If the object sizes are skewed, training won\(aqt be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed where one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming bottleneck in training.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MetricDefinitions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of metric definition objects. Each object specifies the metric name and regular expressions used to parse algorithm logs. Amazon SageMaker publishes each metric to Amazon CloudWatch.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of \fBChannel\fP objects that describes each data input channel.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A channel is a named input source that training algorithms can consume.
.sp

The name of the channel.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

The location of the channel data.
.sp
S3DataSource \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The S3 location of the data source that is associated with a channel.
.sp
S3DataType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you choose \fBS3Prefix\fP , \fBS3Uri\fP identifies a key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses all objects that match the specified key name prefix for model training.
.sp
If you choose \fBManifestFile\fP , \fBS3Uri\fP identifies an object that is a manifest file containing a list of object keys that you want Amazon SageMaker to use for model training.
.sp
If you choose \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP , S3Uri identifies an object that is an augmented manifest file in JSON lines format. This file contains the data you want to use for model training. \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP can only be used if the Channel\(aqs input mode is \fBPipe\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
S3Uri \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Depending on the value specified for the \fBS3DataType\fP , identifies either a key name prefix or a manifest. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A key name prefix might look like this: \fBs3://bucketname/exampleprefix\fP
.IP \(bu 2
A manifest might look like this: \fBs3://bucketname/example.manifest\fP   A manifest is an S3 object which is a JSON file consisting of an array of elements. The first element is a prefix which is followed by one or more suffixes. SageMaker appends the suffix elements to the prefix to get a full set of \fBS3Uri\fP . Note that the prefix must be a valid non\-empty \fBS3Uri\fP that precludes users from specifying a manifest whose individual \fBS3Uri\fP is sourced from different S3 buckets. The following code example shows a valid manifest format:   \fB[ {"prefix": "s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/"},\fP    \fB"relative/path/to/custdata\-1",\fP    \fB"relative/path/custdata\-2",\fP    \fB\&...\fP    \fB"relative/path/custdata\-N"\fP    \fB]\fP   This JSON is equivalent to the following \fBS3Uri\fP list:  \fBs3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/to/custdata\-1\fP    \fBs3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata\-2\fP    \fB\&...\fP    \fBs3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata\-N\fP   The complete set of \fBS3Uri\fP in this manifest is the input data for the channel for this data source. The object that each \fBS3Uri\fP points to must be readable by the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker uses to perform tasks on your behalf.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
S3DataDistributionType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you want Amazon SageMaker to replicate the entire dataset on each ML compute instance that is launched for model training, specify \fBFullyReplicated\fP .
.sp
If you want Amazon SageMaker to replicate a subset of data on each ML compute instance that is launched for model training, specify \fBShardedByS3Key\fP . If there are \fIn\fP ML compute instances launched for a training job, each instance gets approximately 1/\fIn\fP of the number of S3 objects. In this case, model training on each machine uses only the subset of training data.
.sp
Don\(aqt choose more ML compute instances for training than available S3 objects. If you do, some nodes won\(aqt get any data and you will pay for nodes that aren\(aqt getting any training data. This applies in both File and Pipe modes. Keep this in mind when developing algorithms.
.sp
In distributed training, where you use multiple ML compute EC2 instances, you might choose \fBShardedByS3Key\fP . If the algorithm requires copying training data to the ML storage volume (when \fBTrainingInputMode\fP is set to \fBFile\fP ), this copies 1/\fIn\fP of the number of objects.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AttributeNames \-> (list)

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The file system id.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
FileSystemAccessMode \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The access mode of the mount of the directory associated with the channel. A directory can be mounted either in \fBro\fP (read\-only) or \fBrw\fP (read\-write) mode.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CompressionType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If training data is compressed, the compression type. The default value is \fBNone\fP . \fBCompressionType\fP is used only in Pipe input mode. In File mode, leave this field unset or set it to None.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
RecordWrapperType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specify RecordIO as the value when input data is in raw format but the training algorithm requires the RecordIO format. In this case, Amazon SageMaker wraps each individual S3 object in a RecordIO record. If the input data is already in RecordIO format, you don\(aqt need to set this attribute. For more information, see \fI\%Create a Dataset Using RecordIO\fP .
.sp
In File mode, leave this field unset or set it to None.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
InputMode \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) The input mode to use for the data channel in a training job. If you don\(aqt set a value for \fBInputMode\fP , Amazon SageMaker uses the value set for \fBTrainingInputMode\fP . Use this parameter to override the \fBTrainingInputMode\fP setting in a  AlgorithmSpecification request when you have a channel that needs a different input mode from the training job\(aqs general setting. To download the data from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to the provisioned ML storage volume, and mount the directory to a Docker volume, use \fBFile\fP input mode. To stream data directly from Amazon S3 to the container, choose \fBPipe\fP input mode.
.sp
To use a model for incremental training, choose \fBFile\fP input model.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ShuffleConfig \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A configuration for a shuffle option for input data in a channel. If you use \fBS3Prefix\fP for \fBS3DataType\fP , this shuffles the results of the S3 key prefix matches. If you use \fBManifestFile\fP , the order of the S3 object references in the \fBManifestFile\fP is shuffled. If you use \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP , the order of the JSON lines in the \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP is shuffled. The shuffling order is determined using the \fBSeed\fP value.
.sp
For Pipe input mode, shuffling is done at the start of every epoch. With large datasets this ensures that the order of the training data is different for each epoch, it helps reduce bias and possible overfitting. In a multi\-node training job when ShuffleConfig is combined with \fBS3DataDistributionType\fP of \fBShardedByS3Key\fP , the data is shuffled across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch might be sent to a different node on the second epoch.
.sp

The S3 path where model artifacts that you configured when creating the job are stored. Amazon SageMaker creates subfolders for model artifacts.
.sp
KmsKeyId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest using Amazon S3 server\-side encryption. The \fBKmsKeyId\fP can be any of the following formats:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
// KMS Key ID  \fB"1234abcd\-12ab\-34cd\-56ef\-1234567890ab"\fP
.IP \(bu 2

// Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key Alias  \fB"arn:aws:kms:us\-west\-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your master key, the Amazon SageMaker execution role must include permissions to call \fBkms:Encrypt\fP . If you don\(aqt provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role\(aqs account. Amazon SageMaker uses server\-side encryption with KMS\-managed keys for \fBOutputDataConfig\fP . If you use a bucket policy with an \fBs3:PutObject\fP permission that only allows objects with server\-side encryption, set the condition key of \fBs3:x\-amz\-server\-side\-encryption\fP to \fB"aws:kms"\fP . For more information, see \fI\%KMS\-Managed Encryption Keys\fP in the \fIAmazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.\fP
.sp
The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you specify in your \fBCreateTrainingJob\fP , \fBCreateTransformJob\fP , or \fBCreateHyperParameterTuningJob\fP requests.

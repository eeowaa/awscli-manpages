backup-create-backup-plan \- Creates a backup plan using a backup plan name and backup rules
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a backup plan using a backup plan name and backup rules. A backup plan is a document that contains information that AWS Backup uses to schedule tasks that create recovery points for resources.
.sp
If you call \fBCreateBackupPlan\fP with a plan that already exists, an \fBAlreadyExistsException\fP is returned.
.sp

Lifecycle \-> (structure)

.INDENT 3.5
The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. AWS Backup will transition and expire backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.
.sp
Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.
.sp
Only Amazon EFS file system backups can be transitioned to cold storage.

Contains an array of \fBTransition\fP objects specifying how long in days before a recovery point transitions to cold storage or is deleted.
.sp
Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, on the console, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.
.sp
Only Amazon EFS file system backups can be transitioned to cold storage.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

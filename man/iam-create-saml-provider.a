.SH NAME
iam-create-saml-provider \- Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0.
.sp
The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in an IAM role\(aqs trust policy. Such a policy can enable federated users who sign in using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web\-based single sign\-on (SSO) to the AWS Management Console or one that supports API access to AWS.
.sp
When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload a SAML metadata document that you get from your IdP. That document includes the issuer\(aqs name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization\(aqs IdP.

\fB\-\-saml\-metadata\-document\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An XML document generated by an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0. The document includes the issuer\(aqs name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that are received from the IdP. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization\(aqs IdP.

\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the provider to create.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM SAML provider. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that represents user\-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, \fBDepartment\fP or \fBCost Center\fP are common choices.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of \fBDepartment\fP could have values such as \fBHuman Resources\fP , \fBAccounting\fP , and \fBSupport\fP . Tags with a key name of \fBCost Center\fP might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AWS always interprets the tag \fBValue\fP as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma\-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

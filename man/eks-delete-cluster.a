.SH NAME
eks-delete-cluster \- Deletes the Amazon EKS cluster control plane
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the Amazon EKS cluster control plane.
.sp
If you have active services in your cluster that are associated with a load balancer, you must delete those services before deleting the cluster so that the load balancers are deleted properly. Otherwise, you can have orphaned resources in your VPC that prevent you from being able to delete the VPC. For more information, see \fI\%Deleting a Cluster\fP in the \fIAmazon EKS User Guide\fP .
.sp
If you have managed node groups or Fargate profiles attached to the cluster, you must delete them first. For more information, see  DeleteNodegroup and  DeleteFargateProfile .
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

The name of the cluster to delete.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

endpointPublicAccess \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This parameter indicates whether the Amazon EKS private API server endpoint is enabled. If the Amazon EKS private API server endpoint is enabled, Kubernetes API requests that originate from within your cluster\(aqs VPC use the private VPC endpoint instead of traversing the internet. If this value is disabled and you have nodes or AWS Fargate pods in the cluster, then ensure that \fBpublicAccessCidrs\fP includes the necessary CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access Control\fP in the * \fIAmazon EKS User Guide\fP * .

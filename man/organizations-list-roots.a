.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists the roots that are defined in the current organization.

.INDENT 3.5
Always check the \fBNextToken\fP response parameter for a \fBnull\fP value when calling a \fBList*\fP operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The \fBNextToken\fP response parameter value is \fBnull\fP  \fIonly\fP when there are no more results to display.

.sp
This operation can be called only from the organization\(aqs management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.

Policy types can be enabled and disabled in roots. This is distinct from whether they\(aqre available in the organization. When you enable all features, you make policy types available for use in that organization. Individual policy types can then be enabled and disabled in a root. To see the availability of a policy type in an organization, use  DescribeOrganization .

\fBlist\-roots\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBRoots\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Roots \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of roots that are defined in an organization.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains details about a root. A root is a top\-level parent node in the hierarchy of an organization that can contain organizational units (OUs) and accounts. The root contains every AWS account in the organization.
.sp
Id \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier (ID) for the root.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP for a root ID string requires "r\-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Arn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the root.
.sp
For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see \fI\%ARN Formats Supported by Organizations\fP in the \fIAWS Service Authorization Reference\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The friendly name of the root.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP that is used to validate this parameter is a string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PolicyTypes \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The types of policies that are currently enabled for the root and therefore can be attached to the root or to its OUs or accounts.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Even if a policy type is shown as available in the organization, you can separately enable and disable them at the root level by using  EnablePolicyType and  DisablePolicyType . Use  DescribeOrganization to see the availability of the policy types in that organization.

.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains information about a policy type and its status in the associated root.
.sp
Type \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the policy type.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the policy type as it relates to the associated root. To attach a policy of the specified type to a root or to an OU or account in that root, it must be available in the organization and enabled for that root.

If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the \fBNextToken\fP request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output.

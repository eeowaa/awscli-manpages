.sp
\fB\-\-application\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the application. This identifier is displayed as the \fBProject ID\fP on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of items to include in each page of a paginated response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign, and journey metrics.

\fB\-\-segment\-id\fP (string)

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
ExternalId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Deprecated) Your AWS account ID, which you assigned to an external ID key in an IAM trust policy.

We don\(aqt recommend use of external IDs for IAM roles that are assumed by Amazon Pinpoint.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Format \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The format of the files that contain the endpoint definitions to import. Valid values are: CSV, for comma\-separated values format; and, JSON, for newline\-delimited JSON format.
.sp
If the files are stored in an Amazon S3 location and that location contains multiple files that use different formats, Amazon Pinpoint imports data only from the files that use the specified format.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The URL of the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that contains the endpoint definitions to import. This location can be a folder or a single file.

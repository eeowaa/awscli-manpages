.SH NAME
events-create-partner-event-source \- Called by an SaaS partner to create a partner event source
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Called by an SaaS partner to create a partner event source. This operation is not used by AWS customers.
.sp
Each partner event source can be used by one AWS account to create a matching partner event bus in that AWS account. A SaaS partner must create one partner event source for each AWS account that wants to receive those event types.
.sp
A partner event source creates events based on resources within the SaaS partner\(aqs service or application.
.sp
An AWS account that creates a partner event bus that matches the partner event source can use that event bus to receive events from the partner, and then process them using AWS Events rules and targets.
.sp
Partner event source names follow this format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\(ga\(ga \fIpartner_name\fP /\fIevent_namespace\fP /\fIevent_name\fP \(ga\(ga
.sp
\fIpartner_name\fP is determined during partner registration and identifies the partner to AWS customers. \fIevent_namespace\fP is determined by the partner and is a way for the partner to categorize their events. \fIevent_name\fP is determined by the partner, and should uniquely identify an event\-generating resource within the partner system. The combination of \fIevent_namespace\fP and \fIevent_name\fP should help AWS customers decide whether to create an event bus to receive these events.

.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the partner event source. This name must be unique and must be in the format \(ga\(ga \fIpartner_name\fP /\fIevent_namespace\fP /\fIevent_name\fP \(ga\(ga . The AWS account that wants to use this partner event source must create a partner event bus with a name that matches the name of the partner event source.

.INDENT 3.5
The AWS account ID that is permitted to create a matching partner event bus for this partner event source.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

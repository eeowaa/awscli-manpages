.SH NAME
cloudtrail-stop-logging \- Suspends the recording of AWS API calls and log file delivery for the specified trail
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Suspends the recording of AWS API calls and log file delivery for the specified trail. Under most circumstances, there is no need to use this action. You can update a trail without stopping it first. This action is the only way to stop recording. For a trail enabled in all regions, this operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created, or an \fBInvalidHomeRegionException\fP will occur. This operation cannot be called on the shadow trails (replicated trails in other regions) of a trail enabled in all regions.

.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the name or the CloudTrail ARN of the trail for which CloudTrail will stop logging AWS API calls. The format of a trail ARN is:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The distribution\(aqs ID. If the ID is empty, an empty distribution configuration is returned.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBallow\-all\fP : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBredirect\-to\-https\fP : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.
.IP \(bu 2

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously.

The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute \fB200\fP , the response typically won\(aqt be intercepted.
.IP \(bu 2
If you don\(aqt care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify \fB400\fP or \fB500\fP as the \fBResponseCode\fP for all 4xx or 5xx errors.
.IP \(bu 2
You might want to return a \fB200\fP status code (OK) and static website so your customers don\(aqt know that your website is down.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you specify a value for \fBResponseCode\fP , you must also specify a value for \fBResponsePagePath\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
ErrorCachingMinTTL \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in \fBErrorCode\fP . When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.

WebACLId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier that specifies the AWS WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of AWS WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example \fBarn:aws:wafv2:us\-east\-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd\-f30b\-4765\-81a0\-62ad96dd167a\fP . To specify a web ACL created using AWS WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example \fB473e64fd\-f30b\-4765\-81a0\-62ad96dd167a\fP .
.sp
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about AWS WAF, see the \fI\%AWS WAF Developer Guide\fP .

HttpVersion \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that don\(aqt support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.
.sp
For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identification (SNI).
.sp
In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with viewers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance by optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Internet search for "http/2 optimization."

IsIPV6Enabled \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify \fBtrue\fP . If you specify \fBfalse\fP , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code \fBNOERROR\fP and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution.
.sp
In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you\(aqre using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you\(aqre using a custom policy that includes the \fBIpAddress\fP parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don\(aqt enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see \fI\%Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy\fP in the \fIAmazon CloudFront Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
If you\(aqre using an Amazon Route 53 alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You enable IPv6 for the distribution
.IP \(bu 2

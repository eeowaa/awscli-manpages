.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-listener\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-endpoint\-group\-region\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The AWS Region where the endpoint group is located. A listener can have only one endpoint group in a specific Region.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-endpoint\-configurations\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of endpoint objects.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A complex type for endpoints. A resource must be valid and active when you add it as an endpoint.
.sp
EndpointId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID. A resource must be valid and active when you add it as an endpoint.
.sp
An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet\-facing.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Weight \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see \fI\%Endpoint Weights\fP in the \fIAWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ClientIPPreservationEnabled \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators.
.sp
If the value is set to true, the client\(aqs IP address is preserved in the \fBX\-Forwarded\-For\fP request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Preserve Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator\fP in the \fIAWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of this endpoint group.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain name. For example, you can use \fBChangeResourceRecordSets\fP to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.

\fBDeleting Resource Record Sets\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same values that you specified when you created it.

.INDENT 3.5
\fBChange Batches and Transactional Changes\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The request body must include a document with a \fBChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest\fP element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn\(aqt adversely affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone.
.sp
For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the \fBCNAME\fP resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If validation for either the \fBDELETE\fP or the \fBCREATE\fP action fails, then the request is canceled, and the original \fBCNAME\fP record continues to exist.

If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an \fBInvalidChangeBatch\fP error.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBTraffic Flow\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn\(aqt performing as expected. For more information, see \fI\%Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic\fP in the \fIAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide\fP .

\fBSyntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax.
.sp
For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples."
.sp
Don\(aqt refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using \fBChangeResourceRecordSets\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBChange Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When you submit a \fBChangeResourceRecordSets\fP request, Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, \fBGetChange\fP returns a status of \fBPENDING\fP . When propagation is complete, \fBGetChange\fP returns a status of \fBINSYNC\fP . Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see \fI\%GetChange\fP .

Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, \fBwww.example.com\fP . You can optionally include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats \fBwww.example.com\fP (without a trailing dot) and \fBwww.example.com.\fP (with a trailing dot) as identical.
.sp
For information about how to specify characters other than \fBa\-z\fP , \fB0\-9\fP , and \fB\-\fP (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see \fI\%DNS Domain Name Format\fP in the \fIAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide\fP .

SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages.

RFC 7208, \fISender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1\fP , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mechanism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperability issues.

You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the \fBName\fP and \fBType\fP elements.
.IP \(bu 2
For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set \fBWeight\fP to \fB0\fP for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set \fBWeight\fP to \fB0\fP for all resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting \fBWeight\fP to \fB0\fP is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets.

Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations.

Specifying a value for \fBHealthCheckId\fP is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:
.INDENT 0.0

If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
.IP \(bu 2

For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region.

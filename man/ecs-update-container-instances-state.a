ecs-update-container-instances-state \- Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance.
.sp
Once a container instance has reached an \fBACTIVE\fP state, you can change the status of a container instance to \fBDRAINING\fP to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A container instance cannot be changed to \fBDRAINING\fP until it has reached an \fBACTIVE\fP status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When you set a container instance to \fBDRAINING\fP , Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the \fBPENDING\fP state are stopped immediately.
.sp
Service tasks on the container instance that are in the \fBRUNNING\fP state are stopped and replaced according to the service\(aqs deployment configuration parameters, \fBminimumHealthyPercent\fP and \fBmaximumPercent\fP . You can change the deployment configuration of your service using  UpdateService .
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBminimumHealthyPercent\fP is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore \fBdesiredCount\fP temporarily during task replacement. For example, \fBdesiredCount\fP is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can\(aqt remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the \fBRUNNING\fP state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the \fBRUNNING\fP state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBmaximumPercent\fP parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch size. For example, if \fBdesiredCount\fP is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can\(aqt start until the draining tasks have stopped.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any \fBPENDING\fP or \fBRUNNING\fP tasks that do not belong to a service are not affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually.
.sp
A container instance has completed draining when it has no more \fBRUNNING\fP tasks. You can verify this using  ListTasks .
.sp
When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to \fBACTIVE\fP status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

\fB\-\-cluster\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the container instance to update. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

\fB\-\-status\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The container instance state with which to update the container instance. The only valid values for this action are \fBACTIVE\fP and \fBDRAINING\fP . A container instance can only be updated to \fBDRAINING\fP status once it has reached an \fBACTIVE\fP state. If a container instance is in \fBREGISTERING\fP , \fBDEREGISTERING\fP , or \fBREGISTRATION_FAILED\fP state you can describe the container instance but will be unable to update the container instance state.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

\fBTo update the state of a container instance\fP
.sp
The following \fBupdate\-container\-instances\-state\fP updates the state of the specified container instance to \fBDRAINING\fP which will remove it from the cluster is it registered to.

.sp
If your account has opted in to the \fBawsvpcTrunking\fP account setting, then any newly registered container instance will transition to a \fBREGISTERING\fP status while the trunk elastic network interface is provisioned for the instance. If the registration fails, the instance will transition to a \fBREGISTRATION_FAILED\fP status. You can describe the container instance and see the reason for failure in the \fBstatusReason\fP parameter. Once the container instance is terminated, the instance transitions to a \fBDEREGISTERING\fP status while the trunk elastic network interface is deprovisioned. The instance then transitions to an \fBINACTIVE\fP status.
.sp
The \fBACTIVE\fP status indicates that the container instance can accept tasks. The \fBDRAINING\fP indicates that new tasks are not placed on the container instance and any service tasks running on the container instance are removed if possible.

.SH NAME
redshift-describe-event-subscriptions \- Lists descriptions of all the Amazon Redshift event notification subscriptions for a customer account
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists descriptions of all the Amazon Redshift event notification subscriptions for a customer account. If you specify a subscription name, lists the description for that subscription.
.sp
If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all event notification subscriptions that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have \fBowner\fP and \fBenvironment\fP for tag keys, and \fBadmin\fP and \fBtest\fP for tag values, all subscriptions that have any combination of those values are returned.
.sp
If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, subscriptions are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.
.sp

\fBdescribe\-event\-subscriptions\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBEventSubscriptionsList\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-tag\-keys\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching event notification subscriptions that are associated with the specified key or keys. For example, suppose that you have subscriptions that are tagged with keys called \fBowner\fP and \fBenvironment\fP . If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the subscriptions that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

For example, suppose that you have subscriptions that are tagged with values called \fBadmin\fP and \fBtest\fP . If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the subscriptions that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Marker \-> (string)

A value that indicates the starting point for the next set of response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this returned marker value in the \fBMarker\fP parameter and retrying the command. If the \fBMarker\fP field is empty, all response records have been retrieved for the request.

mturk-delete-worker-block \- The DeleteWorkerBlock operation allows you to reinstate a blocked Worker to work on your HITs
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBDeleteWorkerBlock\fP operation allows you to reinstate a blocked Worker to work on your HITs. This operation reverses the effects of the CreateWorkerBlock operation. You need the Worker ID to use this operation. If the Worker ID is missing or invalid, this operation fails and returns the message “WorkerId is invalid.” If the specified Worker is not blocked, this operation returns successfully.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

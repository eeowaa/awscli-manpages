.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because \fBCreateAccount\fP operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use the \fBId\fP member of the \fBCreateAccountStatus\fP response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the  DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.
.IP \(bu 2
Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the \fBCreateAccountResult\fP event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with AWS Organizations, see \fI\%Logging and monitoring in AWS Organizations\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide.\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The user who calls the API to create an account must have the \fBorganizations:CreateAccount\fP permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required service\-linked role named \fBAWSServiceRoleForOrganizations\fP . For more information, see \fI\%AWS Organizations and Service\-Linked Roles\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide\fP .
.sp
If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the \fBorganizations:TagResource\fP permission.
.sp
AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named \fBOrganizationAccountAccessRole\fP by default) that grants users in the management account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization\(aqs management account.
.sp
This operation can be called only from the organization\(aqs management account.
.sp
For more information about creating accounts, see \fI\%Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide.\fP

When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is \fInot\fP automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at \fI\%To leave an organization as a member account\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact \fI\%AWS Support\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact \fI\%AWS Support\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
Using \fBCreateAccount\fP to create multiple temporary accounts isn\(aqt recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost Management Console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see \fI\%Closing an AWS Account\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide\fP .

When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the \fBIAM User and Role Access to Billing Information\fP switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see \fI\%Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools\fP .

(Optional)
.sp
The name of an IAM role that AWS Organizations automatically preconfigures in the new member account.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo create a member account that is automatically part of the organization\fP
.sp
The following example shows how to create a member account in an organization. The member account is configured with the name Production Account and the email address of \fI\%susan@example.com\fP\&. Organizations automatically creates an IAM role using the default name of OrganizationAccountAccessRole because the roleName parameter is not specified. Also, the setting that allows IAM users or roles with sufficient permissions to access account billing data is set to the default value of ALLOW because the IamUserAccessToBilling parameter is not specified. Organizations automatically sends Susan a "Welcome to AWS" email:

.nf
.ft C
aws organizations create\-account \-\-email susan@example.com \-\-account\-name "Production Account"

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The output includes a request object that shows that the status is now \fBIN_PROGRESS\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
        "CreateAccountStatus": {
                "State": "IN_PROGRESS",

        }
}

.sp
You can later query the current status of the request by providing the Id response value to the describe\-create\-account\-status command as the value for the create\-account\-request\-id parameter.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations Users Guide\fP\&.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
CreateAccountStatus \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that contains details about the request to create an account. This response structure might not be fully populated when you first receive it because account creation is an asynchronous process. You can pass the returned \fBCreateAccountStatus\fP ID as a parameter to  DescribeCreateAccountStatus to get status about the progress of the request at later times. You can also check the AWS CloudTrail log for the \fBCreateAccountResult\fP event. For more information, see \fI\%Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide\fP .
.sp
Id \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier (ID) that references this request. You get this value from the response of the initial  CreateAccount request to create the account.

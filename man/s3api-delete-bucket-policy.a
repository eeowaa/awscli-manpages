s3api-delete-bucket-policy \- This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified bucket
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the \fBDeleteBucketPolicy\fP permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner\(aqs account to use this operation.
.sp
If you don\(aqt have \fBDeleteBucketPolicy\fP permissions, Amazon S3 returns a \fB403 Access Denied\fP error. If you have the correct permissions, but you\(aqre not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner\(aqs account, Amazon S3 returns a \fB405 Method Not Allowed\fP error.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

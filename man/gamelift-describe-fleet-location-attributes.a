.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves information on a fleet\(aqs remote locations, including life\-cycle status and any suspended fleet activity.
.sp
This operation can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To get data for specific locations, provide a fleet identifier and a list of locations. Location data is returned in the order that it is requested.
.IP \(bu 2
To get data for all locations, provide a fleet identifier only. Location data is returned in no particular order.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When requesting attributes for multiple locations, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
.sp
If successful, a \fBLocationAttributes\fP object is returned for each requested location. If the fleet does not have a requested location, no information is returned. This operation does not return the home Region. To get information on a fleet\(aqs home Region, call \fBDescribeFleetAttributes\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-fleet\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve remote locations for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-locations\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of fleet locations to retrieve information for. Specify locations in the form of an AWS Region code, such as \fBus\-west\-2\fP .

\fB\-\-limit\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with \fBNextToken\fP to get results as a set of sequential pages. This limit is not currently enforced.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

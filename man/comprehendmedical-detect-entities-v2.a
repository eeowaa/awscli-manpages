.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Inspects the clinical text for a variety of medical entities and returns specific information about them such as entity category, location, and confidence score on that information. Amazon Comprehend Medical only detects medical entities in English language texts.
.sp
The \fBDetectEntitiesV2\fP operation replaces the  DetectEntities operation. This new action uses a different model for determining the entities in your medical text and changes the way that some entities are returned in the output. You should use the \fBDetectEntitiesV2\fP operation in all new applications.
.sp
The \fBDetectEntitiesV2\fP operation returns the \fBAcuity\fP and \fBDirection\fP entities as attributes instead of types.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-text\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A UTF\-8 string containing the clinical content being examined for entities. Each string must contain fewer than 20,000 bytes of characters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBdescribe\-notifications\-for\-budget\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBNotifications\fP

\fB\-\-account\-id\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The \fBaccountId\fP that is associated with the budget whose notifications you want descriptions of.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-budget\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the budget whose notifications you want descriptions of.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Notifications \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of notifications that are associated with a budget.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A notification that is associated with a budget. A budget can have up to ten notifications.
.sp
Each notification must have at least one subscriber. A notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.
.sp
For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be notified when you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the following parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A notificationType of \fBACTUAL\fP
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBthresholdType\fP of \fBPERCENTAGE\fP
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBcomparisonOperator\fP of \fBGREATER_THAN\fP
.IP \(bu 2
A notification \fBthreshold\fP of \fB80\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
NotificationType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Whether the notification is for how much you have spent (\fBACTUAL\fP ) or for how much you\(aqre forecasted to spend (\fBFORECASTED\fP ).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ComparisonOperator \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The comparison that is used for this notification.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Threshold \-> (double)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage, and many customers find value being alerted between 50% \- 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum limit for your threshold is 1,000,000% above the budgeted amount.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ThresholdType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of threshold for a notification. For \fBABSOLUTE_VALUE\fP thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For \fBPERCENTAGE\fP thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a \fBPERCENTAGE\fP threshold of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
NotificationState \-> (string)

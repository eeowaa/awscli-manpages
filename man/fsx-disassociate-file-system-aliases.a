fsx-disassociate-file-system-aliases \- Use this action to disassociate, or remove, one or more Domain Name Service (DNS) aliases from an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Use this action to disassociate, or remove, one or more Domain Name Service (DNS) aliases from an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. If you attempt to disassociate a DNS alias that is not associated with the file system, Amazon FSx responds with a 400 Bad Request. For more information, see \fI\%Working with DNS Aliases\fP .
.sp
The system generated response showing the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting to disassociate from the file system. Use the API operation to monitor the status of the aliases Amazon FSx is disassociating with the file system.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

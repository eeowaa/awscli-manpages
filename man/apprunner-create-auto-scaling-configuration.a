.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Create an AWS App Runner automatic scaling configuration resource. App Runner requires this resource when you create App Runner services that require non\-default auto scaling settings. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services.
.sp
Create multiple revisions of a configuration by using the same \fBAutoScalingConfigurationName\fP and different \fBAutoScalingConfigurationRevision\fP values. When you create a service, you can set it to use the latest active revision of an auto scaling configuration or a specific revision.
.sp
Configure a higher \fBMinSize\fP to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the AWS Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost.
.sp
Configure a lower \fBMaxSize\fP to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-auto\-scaling\-configuration\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A name for the auto scaling configuration. When you use it for the first time in an AWS Region, App Runner creates revision number \fB1\fP of this name. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-concurrency\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of concurrent requests that you want an instance to process. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit, App Runner scales up your service.
.sp
Default: \fB100\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-min\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for your service. The service always has at least \fBMinSize\fP provisioned instances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest of them (provisioned and inactive instances) are a cost\-effective compute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You pay for memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset.
.sp
App Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code.
.sp
Default: \fB1\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of instances that your service scales up to. At most \fBMaxSize\fP instances actively serve traffic for your service.
.sp
Default: \fB25\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of metadata items that you can associate with your auto scaling configuration resource. A tag is a key\-value pair.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Describes a tag that is applied to an AWS App Runner resource. A tag is a metadata item consisting of a key\-value pair.
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key of the tag.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Releases the specified Elastic IP address.
.sp
[EC2\-Classic, default VPC] Releasing an Elastic IP address automatically disassociates it from any instance that it\(aqs associated with. To disassociate an Elastic IP address without releasing it, use  DisassociateAddress .
.sp
[Nondefault VPC] You must use  DisassociateAddress to disassociate the Elastic IP address before you can release it. Otherwise, Amazon EC2 returns an error (\fBInvalidIPAddress.InUse\fP ).
.sp
After releasing an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool. Be sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that communicate with the address. If you attempt to release an Elastic IP address that you already released, you\(aqll get an \fBAuthFailure\fP error if the address is already allocated to another AWS account.
.sp
[EC2\-VPC] After you release an Elastic IP address for use in a VPC, you might be able to recover it. For more information, see  AllocateAddress .
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-allocation\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
[EC2\-VPC] The allocation ID. Required for EC2\-VPC.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-public\-ip\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
[EC2\-Classic] The Elastic IP address. Required for EC2\-Classic.

.sp
\fB\-\-network\-border\-group\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The set of Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones from which AWS advertises IP addresses.
.sp
If you provide an incorrect network border group, you will receive an \fBInvalidAddress.NotFound\fP error. For more information, see \fI\%Error Codes\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You cannot use a network border group with EC2 Classic. If you attempt this operation on EC2 classic, you will receive an \fBInvalidParameterCombination\fP error. For more information, see \fI\%Error Codes\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \fBDryRunOperation\fP . Otherwise, it is \fBUnauthorizedOperation\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

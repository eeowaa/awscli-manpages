.SH NAME
dynamodb-delete-table \- The DeleteTable operation deletes a table and all of its items
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBDeleteTable\fP operation deletes a table and all of its items. After a \fBDeleteTable\fP request, the specified table is in the \fBDELETING\fP state until DynamoDB completes the deletion. If the table is in the \fBACTIVE\fP state, you can delete it. If a table is in \fBCREATING\fP or \fBUPDATING\fP states, then DynamoDB returns a \fBResourceInUseException\fP . If the specified table does not exist, DynamoDB returns a \fBResourceNotFoundException\fP . If table is already in the \fBDELETING\fP state, no error is returned.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
DynamoDB might continue to accept data read and write operations, such as \fBGetItem\fP and \fBPutItem\fP , on a table in the \fBDELETING\fP state until the table deletion is complete.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When you delete a table, any indexes on that table are also deleted.
.sp
If you have DynamoDB Streams enabled on the table, then the corresponding stream on that table goes into the \fBDISABLED\fP state, and the stream is automatically deleted after 24 hours.
.sp
Use the \fBDescribeTable\fP action to check the status of the table.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Backfilling \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether the index is currently backfilling. \fIBackfilling\fP is the process of reading items from the table and determining whether they can be added to the index. (Not all items will qualify: For example, a partition key cannot have any duplicate values.) If an item can be added to the index, DynamoDB will do so. After all items have been processed, the backfilling operation is complete and \fBBackfilling\fP is false.
.sp
You can delete an index that is being created during the \fBBackfilling\fP phase when \fBIndexStatus\fP is set to CREATING and \fBBackfilling\fP is true. You can\(aqt delete the index that is being created when \fBIndexStatus\fP is set to CREATING and \fBBackfilling\fP is false.

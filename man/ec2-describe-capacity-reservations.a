.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes one or more of your Capacity Reservations. The results describe only the Capacity Reservations in the AWS Region that you\(aqre currently using.
.sp
See also: AWS API Documentation
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBdescribe\-capacity\-reservations\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBCapacityReservations\fP

.IP \(bu 2
\fBavailability\-zone\fP \- The Availability Zone ID of the Capacity Reservation.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtenancy\fP \- Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdefault\fP \- The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other AWS accounts.

.IP \(bu 2
\fBoutpost\-arn\fP \- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on which the Capacity Reservation was created.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstate\fP \- The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can be in one of the following states:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBactive\fP \- The Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity is available for your use.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBexpired\fP \- The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at the date and time specified in your request. The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcancelled\fP \- The Capacity Reservation was cancelled. The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpending\fP \- The Capacity Reservation request was successful but the capacity provisioning is still pending.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfailed\fP \- The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A request might fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests are retained for 60 minutes.

.IP \(bu 2
\fBstart\-date\fP \- The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was started.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBend\-date\fP \- The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation\(aqs state changes to expired when it reaches its end date and time.
.IP \(bu 2

.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBopen\fP \- The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtargeted\fP \- The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.

\fB\-\-dry\-run\fP | \fB\-\-no\-dry\-run\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \fBDryRunOperation\fP . Otherwise, it is \fBUnauthorizedOperation\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

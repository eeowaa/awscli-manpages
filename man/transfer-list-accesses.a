.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the maximum number of access SIDs to return.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you can get additional results from the \fBListAccesses\fP call, a \fBNextToken\fP parameter is returned in the output. You can then pass in a subsequent command to the \fBNextToken\fP parameter to continue listing additional accesses.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-server\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A system\-assigned unique identifier for a server that has users assigned to it.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
NextToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you can get additional results from the \fBListAccesses\fP call, a \fBNextToken\fP parameter is returned in the output. You can then pass in a subsequent command to the \fBNextToken\fP parameter to continue listing additional accesses.

.sp
ServerId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A system\-assigned unique identifier for a server that has users assigned to it.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Accesses \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns the accesses and their properties for the \fBServerId\fP value that you specify.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Lists the properties for one or more specified associated accesses.
.sp
HomeDirectory \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the landing directory (or folder), which is the location that files are written to or read from in an Amazon S3 bucket, for the described access.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HomeDirectoryType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users\(aq home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to \fBPATH\fP , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to \fBLOGICAL\fP , you must provide mappings in the \fBHomeDirectoryMappings\fP for how you want to make Amazon S3 paths visible to your users.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Role \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls access to your Amazon S3 bucket from the specified associated access. The policies attached to this role will determine the level of access that you want to provide the associated access when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or buckets. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows a server to access your resources when servicing transfer requests for the associated access.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ExternalId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. Think of the \fBExternalID\fP as a group membership mechanism that uses a unique identifier (often a SID, but could be a group name or something else) as a basis. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the \fBExternalId\fP parameter. A cross\-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account.
.sp
The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/\-

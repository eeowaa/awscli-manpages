route53resolver-create-resolver-endpoint \- Creates a Resolver endpoint
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a Resolver endpoint. There are two types of Resolver endpoints, inbound and outbound:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An \fIinbound Resolver endpoint\fP forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your network.
.IP \(bu 2
An \fIoutbound Resolver endpoint\fP forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your network.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-creator\-request\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. \fBCreatorRequestId\fP can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
\fB\-\-security\-group\-ids\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of one or more security groups that you want to use to control access to this VPC. The security group that you specify must include one or more inbound rules (for inbound Resolver endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound Resolver endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP access. For inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access, open the port that you\(aqre using for DNS queries on your network.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver endpoint. Valid values include the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATING\fP : Resolver is creating and configuring one or more Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOPERATIONAL\fP : The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint are correctly configured and able to pass inbound or outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUPDATING\fP : Resolver is associating or disassociating one or more network interfaces with this endpoint.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAUTO_RECOVERING\fP : Resolver is trying to recover one or more of the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint. During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with limited capacity because of the limit on the number of DNS queries per IP address (per network interface). For the current limit, see \fI\%Limits on Route 53 Resolver\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACTION_NEEDED\fP : This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can\(aqt automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend that you check each IP address that you associated with the endpoint. For each IP address that isn\(aqt available, add another IP address and then delete the IP address that isn\(aqt available. (An endpoint must always include at least two IP addresses.) A status of \fBACTION_NEEDED\fP can have a variety of causes. Here are two common causes:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
One or more of the network interfaces that are associated with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.
.IP \(bu 2
The network interface couldn\(aqt be created for some reason that\(aqs outside the control of Resolver.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETING\fP : Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the associated network interfaces.

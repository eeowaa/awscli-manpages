.SH NAME
lex-models-delete-utterances \- Deletes stored utterances
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes stored utterances.
.sp
Amazon Lex stores the utterances that users send to your bot. Utterances are stored for 15 days for use with the  GetUtterancesView operation, and then stored indefinitely for use in improving the ability of your bot to respond to user input.
.sp
Use the \fBDeleteUtterances\fP operation to manually delete stored utterances for a specific user. When you use the \fBDeleteUtterances\fP operation, utterances stored for improving your bot\(aqs ability to respond to user input are deleted immediately. Utterances stored for use with the \fBGetUtterancesView\fP operation are deleted after 15 days.
.sp
This operation requires permissions for the \fBlex:DeleteUtterances\fP action.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBlist\-analyzers\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBanalyzers\fP

\fB\-\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of analyzer.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
analyzers \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The analyzers retrieved.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains information about the analyzer.
.sp
arn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the analyzer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
createdAt \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A timestamp for the time at which the analyzer was created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
lastResourceAnalyzed \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The resource that was most recently analyzed by the analyzer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
lastResourceAnalyzedAt \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The time at which the most recently analyzed resource was analyzed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the analyzer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the analyzer. An \fBActive\fP analyzer successfully monitors supported resources and generates new findings. The analyzer is \fBDisabled\fP when a user action, such as removing trusted access for AWS IAM Access Analyzer from AWS Organizations, causes the analyzer to stop generating new findings. The status is \fBCreating\fP when the analyzer creation is in progress and \fBFailed\fP when the analyzer creation has failed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
statusReason \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBstatusReason\fP provides more details about the current status of the analyzer. For example, if the creation for the analyzer fails, a \fBFailed\fP status is returned. For an analyzer with organization as the type, this failure can be due to an issue with creating the service\-linked roles required in the member accounts of the AWS organization.
.sp
code \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The reason code for the current status of the analyzer.
.UNINDENT

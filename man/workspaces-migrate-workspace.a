.SH NAME
workspaces-migrate-workspace \- Migrates a WorkSpace from one operating system or bundle type to another, while retaining the data on the user volume
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Migrates a WorkSpace from one operating system or bundle type to another, while retaining the data on the user volume.
.sp
The migration process recreates the WorkSpace by using a new root volume from the target bundle image and the user volume from the last available snapshot of the original WorkSpace. During migration, the original \fBD:\eUsers\e%USERNAME%\fP user profile folder is renamed to \fBD:\eUsers\e%USERNAME%MMddyyTHHmmss%.NotMigrated\fP . A new \fBD:\eUsers\e%USERNAME%\e\fP folder is generated by the new OS. Certain files in the old user profile are moved to the new user profile.
.sp
For available migration scenarios, details about what happens during migration, and best practices, see \fI\%Migrate a WorkSpace\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

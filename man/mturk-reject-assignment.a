.SH NAME
mturk-reject-assignment \- The RejectAssignment operation rejects the results of a completed assignment
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBRejectAssignment\fP operation rejects the results of a completed assignment.
.sp
You can include an optional feedback message with the rejection, which the Worker can see in the Status section of the web site. When you include a feedback message with the rejection, it helps the Worker understand why the assignment was rejected, and can improve the quality of the results the Worker submits in the future.
.sp
Only the Requester who created the HIT can reject an assignment for the HIT.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-include\-resource\-placeholders\fP | \fB\-\-no\-include\-resource\-placeholders\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The level of detail that you want to generate. You can specify whether to generate policies with placeholders for resource ARNs for actions that support resource level granularity in policies.
.sp
For example, in the resource section of a policy, you can receive a placeholder such as \fB"Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::${BucketName}"\fP instead of \fB"*"\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-include\-service\-level\-template\fP | \fB\-\-no\-include\-service\-level\-template\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The level of detail that you want to generate. You can specify whether to generate service\-level policies.
.sp
Access Analyzer uses \fBiam:servicelastaccessed\fP to identify services that have been used recently to create this service\-level template.

.sp
\fB\-\-job\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBJobId\fP that is returned by the \fBStartPolicyGeneration\fP operation. The \fBJobId\fP can be used with \fBGetGeneratedPolicy\fP to retrieve the generated policies or used with \fBCancelPolicyGeneration\fP to cancel the policy generation request.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

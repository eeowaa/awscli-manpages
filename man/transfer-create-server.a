transfer-create-server \- Instantiates an auto-scaling virtual server based on the selected file transfer protocol in AWS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Instantiates an auto\-scaling virtual server based on the selected file transfer protocol in AWS. When you make updates to your file transfer protocol\-enabled server or when you work with users, use the service\-generated \fBServerId\fP property that is assigned to the newly created server.

.INDENT 3.5
The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose to make your server\(aqs endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it.

After March 31, 2021, you won\(aqt be able to create a server using \fBEndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT\fP in your AWS account if your account hasn\(aqt already done so before March 31, 2021. If you have already created servers with \fBEndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT\fP in your AWS account on or before March 31, 2021, you will not be affected. After this date, use \fBEndpointType\fP =\(ga\(gaVPC\(ga\(ga .

.sp
It is recommended that you use \fBVPC\fP as the \fBEndpointType\fP . With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server\(aqs endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client\(aqs public IP address. This is not possible with \fBEndpointType\fP set to \fBVPC_ENDPOINT\fP .

\fB\-\-identity\-provider\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the mode of authentication for a server. The default value is \fBSERVICE_MANAGED\fP , which allows you to store and access user credentials within the AWS Transfer Family service. Use \fBAWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE\fP to provide access to Active Directory groups in AWS Managed Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your on\-premises environment or in AWS using AD Connectors. This option also requires you to provide a Directory ID using the \fBIdentityProviderDetails\fP parameter. Use the \fBAPI_GATEWAY\fP value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The \fBAPI_GATEWAY\fP setting requires you to provide an API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication using the \fBIdentityProviderDetails\fP parameter.

If \fBProtocol\fP includes either \fBFTP\fP or \fBFTPS\fP , then the \fBEndpointType\fP must be \fBVPC\fP and the \fBIdentityProviderType\fP must be \fBAWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE\fP or \fBAPI_GATEWAY\fP .

If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values.

\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request.

Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

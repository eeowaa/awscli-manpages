.SH NAME
datasync-list-locations \- Returns a list of source and destination locations
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns a list of source and destination locations.
.sp
If you have more locations than are returned in a response (that is, the response returns only a truncated list of your agents), the response contains a token that you can specify in your next request to fetch the next page of locations.
.sp

\fBlist\-locations\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBLocations\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-filters\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You can use API filters to narrow down the list of resources returned by \fBListLocations\fP . For example, to retrieve all tasks on a specific source location, you can use \fBListLocations\fP with filter name \fBLocationType S3\fP and \fBOperator Equals\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
You can use API filters to narrow down the list of resources returned by \fBListLocations\fP . For example, to retrieve all your Amazon S3 locations, you can use \fBListLocations\fP with filter name \fBLocationType S3\fP and \fBOperator Equals\fP .
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the filter being used. Each API call supports a list of filters that are available for it (for example, \fBLocationType\fP for \fBListLocations\fP ).

.sp
Values \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The values that you want to filter for. For example, you might want to display only Amazon S3 locations.

.sp
Operator \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The operator that is used to compare filter values (for example, \fBEquals\fP or \fBContains\fP ). For more about API filtering operators, see \fI\%API filters for ListTasks and ListLocations\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Locations \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array that contains a list of locations.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents a single entry in a list of locations. \fBLocationListEntry\fP returns an array that contains a list of locations when the \fI\%ListLocations\fP operation is called.
.sp
LocationArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the location. For Network File System (NFS) or Amazon EFS, the location is the export path. For Amazon S3, the location is the prefix path that you want to mount and use as the root of the location.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
LocationUri \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents a list of URLs of a location. \fBLocationUri\fP returns an array that contains a list of locations when the \fI\%ListLocations\fP operation is called.
.sp
Format: \fBTYPE://GLOBAL_ID/SUBDIR\fP .
.sp
TYPE designates the type of location. Valid values: NFS | EFS | S3.
.sp
GLOBAL_ID is the globally unique identifier of the resource that backs the location. An example for EFS is \fBus\-east\-2.fs\-abcd1234\fP . An example for Amazon S3 is the bucket name, such as \fBmyBucket\fP . An example for NFS is a valid IPv4 address or a host name compliant with Domain Name Service (DNS).
.sp
SUBDIR is a valid file system path, delimited by forward slashes as is the 
.nf
*
.fi
nix convention. For NFS and Amazon EFS, it\(aqs the export path to mount the location. For Amazon S3, it\(aqs the prefix path that you mount to and treat as the root of the location.

\fBlist\-game\-server\-groups\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBGameServerGroups\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
Properties that describe a game server group resource. A game server group manages certain properties related to a corresponding EC2 Auto Scaling group.
.sp
A game server group is created by a successful call to \fBCreateGameServerGroup\fP and deleted by calling \fBDeleteGameServerGroup\fP . Game server group activity can be temporarily suspended and resumed by calling \fBSuspendGameServerGroup\fP and \fBResumeGameServerGroup\fP , respectively.

.UNINDENT
.sp
An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup . All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

An EC2 instance type designation.

WeightedCapacity \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type\(aqs cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost\-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see \fI\%Instance Weighting\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide\fP . Default value is "1".

BalancingStrategy \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On\-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSPOT_ONLY\fP \- Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSPOT_PREFERRED\fP \- (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On\-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On\-Demand Instances.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBON_DEMAND_ONLY\fP \- Only On\-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.

.sp
GameServerProtectionPolicy \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale\-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status.

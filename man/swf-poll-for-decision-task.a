.SH NAME
swf-poll-for-decision-task \- Used by deciders to get a  DecisionTask from the specified decision taskList 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Used by deciders to get a  DecisionTask from the specified decision \fBtaskList\fP . A decision task may be returned for any open workflow execution that is using the specified task list. The task includes a paginated view of the history of the workflow execution. The decider should use the workflow type and the history to determine how to properly handle the task.
.sp
This action initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon a task becomes available. If no decision task is available in the specified task list before the timeout of 60 seconds expires, an empty result is returned. An empty result, in this context, means that a DecisionTask is returned, but that the value of taskToken is an empty string.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Deciders should set their client side socket timeout to at least 70 seconds (10 seconds higher than the timeout).

Because the number of workflow history events for a single workflow execution might be very large, the result returned might be split up across a number of pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make additional calls to \fBPollForDecisionTask\fP using the \fBnextPageToken\fP returned by the initial call. Note that you do \fInot\fP call \fBGetWorkflowExecutionHistory\fP with this \fBnextPageToken\fP . Instead, call \fBPollForDecisionTask\fP again.

.UNINDENT
.sp
You can use IAM policies to control this action\(aqs access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use a \fBResource\fP element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
.IP \(bu 2
Use an \fBAction\fP element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
.IP \(bu 2
Constrain the \fBtaskList.name\fP parameter by using a \fBCondition\fP element with the \fBswf:taskList.name\fP key to allow the action to access only certain task lists.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the caller doesn\(aqt have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute\(aqs \fBcause\fP parameter is set to \fBOPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED\fP . For details and example IAM policies, see \fI\%Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows\fP in the \fIAmazon SWF Developer Guide\fP .

\fBpoll\-for\-decision\-task\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBevents\fP

\fB\-\-identity\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values.

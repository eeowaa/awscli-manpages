comprehendmedical-infer-icd10-cm \- InferICD10CM detects medical conditions as entities listed in a patient record and links those entities to normalized concept identifiers in the ICD-10-CM knowledge base from the Centers for Disease Control
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
InferICD10CM detects medical conditions as entities listed in a patient record and links those entities to normalized concept identifiers in the ICD\-10\-CM knowledge base from the Centers for Disease Control. Amazon Comprehend Medical only detects medical entities in English language texts.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-text\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The input text used for analysis. The input for InferICD10CM is a string from 1 to 10000 characters.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

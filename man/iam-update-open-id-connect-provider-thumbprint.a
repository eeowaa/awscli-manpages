.SH NAME
iam-update-open-id-connect-provider-thumbprint \- Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints.
.sp
The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)
.sp
Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider\(aqs certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider\(aqs certificate \fIdoes\fP change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider\(aqs certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the \fBUpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint\fP operation to highly privileged users.

\fB\-\-open\-id\-connect\-provider\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM OIDC provider resource object for which you want to update the thumbprint. You can get a list of OIDC provider ARNs by using the  ListOpenIDConnectProviders operation.
.sp
For more information about ARNs, see \fI\%Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-thumbprint\-list\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of certificate thumbprints that are associated with the specified IAM OpenID Connect provider. For more information, see  CreateOpenIDConnectProvider .
.sp
(string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider\(aqs server certificate.
.sp
The identity provider\(aqs server certificate thumbprint is the hex\-encoded SHA\-1 hash value of the self\-signed X.509 certificate. This thumbprint is used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. The thumbprint is always a 40\-character string.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

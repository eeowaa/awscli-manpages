\fBlist\-endpoint\-groups\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBEndpointGroups\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-listener\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
EndpointGroups \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of the endpoint groups associated with a listener.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A complex type for the endpoint group. An AWS Region can have only one endpoint group for a specific listener.
.sp
EndpointGroupArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EndpointGroupRegion \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The AWS Region where the endpoint group is located.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EndpointDescriptions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of endpoint objects.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group can include one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.
.sp
EndpointId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID.
.sp
An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet\-facing.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Weight \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see \fI\%Endpoint Weights\fP in the \fIAWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HealthState \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The health status of the endpoint.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HealthReason \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns a null result.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ClientIPPreservationEnabled \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators.
.sp
If the value is set to true, the client\(aqs IP address is preserved in the \fBX\-Forwarded\-For\fP request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator\fP in the \fIAWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide\fP .

.sp
TrafficDialPercentage \-> (float)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener.
.sp
Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.
.sp
The default value is 100.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HealthCheckPort \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group.
.sp
The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HealthCheckProtocol \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HealthCheckPath \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HealthCheckIntervalSeconds \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The default value is 30.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ThresholdCount \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PortOverrides \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Allows you to override the destination ports used to route traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you to map a list of external destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to a list of internal destination ports that you want an application endpoint to receive traffic on.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Port overrides\fP in the \fIAWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
ListenerPort \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EndpointPort \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

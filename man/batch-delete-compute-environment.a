.SH NAME
batch-delete-compute-environment \- Deletes an AWS Batch compute environment
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes an AWS Batch compute environment.
.sp
Before you can delete a compute environment, you must set its state to \fBDISABLED\fP with the  UpdateComputeEnvironment API operation and disassociate it from any job queues with the  UpdateJobQueue API operation. Compute environments that use AWS Fargate resources must terminate all active jobs on that compute environment before deleting the compute environment. If this isn\(aqt done, the compute environment enters an invalid state.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

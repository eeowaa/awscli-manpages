The name of the ML model to be described.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

DataPreProcessingConfiguration \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The configuration is the \fBTargetSamplingRate\fP , which is the sampling rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equipment. For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a 1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training, the \fBTargetSamplingRate\fP is 1 minute.
.sp
When providing a value for the \fBTargetSamplingRate\fP , you must attach the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate is therefore \fIPT1S\fP , the value for a 15 minute rate is \fIPT15M\fP , and the value for a 1 hour rate is \fIPT1H\fP

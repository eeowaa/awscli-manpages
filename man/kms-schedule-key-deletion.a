.SH NAME
kms-schedule-key-deletion \- Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). You may provide a waiting period, specified in days, before deletion occurs. If you do not provide a waiting period, the default period of 30 days is used. When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes to \fBPendingDeletion\fP . Before the waiting period ends, you can use  CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. To prevent the use of a CMK without deleting it, use  DisableKey .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a \fI\%custom key store\fP , when the waiting period expires, \fBScheduleKeyDeletion\fP deletes the CMK from AWS KMS. Then AWS KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually \fI\%delete the orphaned key material\fP from the cluster and its backups.
.sp
For more information about scheduling a CMK for deletion, see \fI\%Deleting Customer Master Keys\fP in the \fIAWS Key Management Service Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see \fI\%How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key\fP in the \fIAWS Key Management Service Developer Guide\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
\fBCross\-account use\fP : No. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-key\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier of the customer master key (CMK) to delete.
.sp
Specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Key ID: \fB1234abcd\-12ab\-34cd\-56ef\-1234567890ab\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Key ARN: \fBarn:aws:kms:us\-east\-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd\-12ab\-34cd\-56ef\-1234567890ab\fP

To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-pending\-window\-in\-days\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The waiting period, specified in number of days. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the customer master key (CMK).
.sp
This value is optional. If you include a value, it must be between 7 and 30, inclusive. If you do not include a value, it defaults to 30.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo schedule the deletion of a customer managed CMK.\fP
.sp
The following \fBschedule\-key\-deletion\fP example schedules the specified customer managed CMK to be deleted in 15 days.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB\-\-key\-id\fP parameter identifies the CMK. This example uses a key ARN value, but you can use either the key ID or the ARN of the CMK.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB\-\-pending\-window\-in\-days\fP parameter specifies the length of the waiting period. By default, the waiting period is 30 days. This example specifies a value of 15, which tells AWS to permanently delete the CMK 15 days after the command completes.

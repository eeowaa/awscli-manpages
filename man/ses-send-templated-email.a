.SH NAME
ses-send-templated-email \- Composes an email message using an email template and immediately queues it for sending
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Composes an email message using an email template and immediately queues it for sending.
.sp
In order to send email using the \fBSendTemplatedEmail\fP operation, your call to the API must meet the following requirements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using the  CreateTemplate operation.
.IP \(bu 2
The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.
.IP \(bu 2
If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see \fI\%Verifying Email Addresses and Domains\fP in the \fIAmazon SES Developer Guide.\fP
.IP \(bu 2
The maximum message size is 10 MB.
.IP \(bu 2
Calls to the \fBSendTemplatedEmail\fP operation may only include one \fBDestination\fP parameter. A destination is a set of recipients who will receive the same version of the email. The \fBDestination\fP parameter can include up to 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBDestination\fP parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format \fIUserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain\fP ), the entire message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If your call to the \fBSendTemplatedEmail\fP operation includes all of the required parameters, Amazon SES accepts it and returns a Message ID. However, if Amazon SES can\(aqt render the email because the template contains errors, it doesn\(aqt send the email. Additionally, because it already accepted the message, Amazon SES doesn\(aqt return a message stating that it was unable to send the email.
.sp
For these reasons, we highly recommend that you set up Amazon SES to send you notifications when Rendering Failure events occur. For more information, see \fI\%Sending Personalized Email Using the Amazon SES API\fP in the \fIAmazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-source\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the \fI\%Amazon SES Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the \fBSourceArn\fP parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the \fI\%Amazon SES Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in \fI\%RFC6531\fP . For this reason, the \fIlocal part\fP of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain \fI\%7\-bit ASCII characters\fP . If the \fIdomain part\fP of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non\-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in \fI\%RFC3492\fP . The sender name (also known as the \fIfriendly name\fP ) may contain non\-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded\-word syntax, as described in\(gaRFC 2047 <\fI\%https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047\fP>\(ga__ . MIME encoded\-word syntax uses the following form: \fB=?charset?encoding?encoded\-text?=\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
The email address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message will be returned from the recipient\(aqs ISP; this message will then be forwarded to the email address specified by the \fBReturnPath\fP parameter. The \fBReturnPath\fP parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES.

Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
cognito-idp-admin-reset-user-password \- Resets the specified user(aqs password in a user pool as an administrator
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Resets the specified user\(aqs password in a user pool as an administrator. Works on any user.
.sp
When a developer calls this API, the current password is invalidated, so it must be changed. If a user tries to sign in after the API is called, the app will get a PasswordResetRequiredException exception back and should direct the user down the flow to reset the password, which is the same as the forgot password flow. In addition, if the user pool has phone verification selected and a verified phone number exists for the user, or if email verification is selected and a verified email exists for the user, calling this API will also result in sending a message to the end user with the code to change their password.
.sp
Calling this action requires developer credentials.

\fB\-\-client\-metadata\fP (map)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A map of custom key\-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.
.sp
You create custom workflows by assigning AWS Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminResetUserPassword API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the \fIcustom message\fP trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a \fBclientMetadata\fP attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminResetUserPassword request. In your function code in AWS Lambda, you can process the \fBclientMetadata\fP value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Customizing User Pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers\fP in the \fIAmazon Cognito Developer Guide\fP .

\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Take the following limitations into consideration when you use the ClientMetadata parameter:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Amazon Cognito does not store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to AWS Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration does not include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.
.IP \(bu 2
Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.
.IP \(bu 2
Amazon Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata value, so don\(aqt use it to provide sensitive information.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

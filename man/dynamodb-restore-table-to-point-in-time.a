.SH NAME
dynamodb-restore-table-to-point-in-time \- Restores the specified table to the specified point in time within EarliestRestorableDateTime and LatestRestorableDateTime 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Restores the specified table to the specified point in time within \fBEarliestRestorableDateTime\fP and \fBLatestRestorableDateTime\fP . You can restore your table to any point in time during the last 35 days. Any number of users can execute up to 4 concurrent restores (any type of restore) in a given account.
.sp
When you restore using point in time recovery, DynamoDB restores your table data to the state based on the selected date and time (day:hour:minute:second) to a new table.
.sp
Along with data, the following are also included on the new restored table using point in time recovery:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Global secondary indexes (GSIs)
.IP \(bu 2
Local secondary indexes (LSIs)
.IP \(bu 2
Provisioned read and write capacity
.IP \(bu 2
Encryption settings
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
All these settings come from the current settings of the source table at the time of restore.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You must manually set up the following on the restored table:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Auto scaling policies
.IP \(bu 2
IAM policies
.IP \(bu 2
Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alarms
.IP \(bu 2

The partition key of an item is also known as its \fIhash attribute\fP . The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB\(aqs usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.
.sp
The sort key of an item is also known as its \fIrange attribute\fP . The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents \fIa single element\fP of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.
.sp
A \fBKeySchemaElement\fP represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one \fBKeySchemaElement\fP (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one \fBKeySchemaElement\fP for the partition key, and another \fBKeySchemaElement\fP for the sort key.
.sp
A \fBKeySchemaElement\fP must be a scalar, top\-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

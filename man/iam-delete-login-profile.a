.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the password for the specified IAM user, which terminates the user\(aqs ability to access AWS services through the AWS Management Console.
.sp
You can use the AWS CLI, the AWS API, or the \fBUsers\fP page in the IAM console to delete a password for any IAM user. You can use  ChangePassword to update, but not delete, your own password in the \fBMy Security Credentials\fP page in the AWS Management Console.

Deleting a user\(aqs password does not prevent a user from accessing AWS through the command line interface or the API.

For more information about making keys inactive or deleting them, see  UpdateAccessKey and  DeleteAccessKey .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

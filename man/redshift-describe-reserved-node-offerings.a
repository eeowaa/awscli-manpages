.SH NAME
redshift-describe-reserved-node-offerings \- Returns a list of the available reserved node offerings by Amazon Redshift with their descriptions including the node type, the fixed and recurring costs of reserving the node and duration the node will be reserved for you
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns a list of the available reserved node offerings by Amazon Redshift with their descriptions including the node type, the fixed and recurring costs of reserving the node and duration the node will be reserved for you. These descriptions help you determine which reserve node offering you want to purchase. You then use the unique offering ID in you call to  PurchaseReservedNodeOffering to reserve one or more nodes for your Amazon Redshift cluster.
.sp
For more information about reserved node offerings, go to \fI\%Purchasing Reserved Nodes\fP in the \fIAmazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide\fP .

\fBdescribe\-reserved\-node\-offerings\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBReservedNodeOfferings\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-reserved\-node\-offering\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the offering.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

If you want to purchase a reserved node offering, you can call \fBpurchase\-reserved\-node\-offering\fP using a valid
\fIReservedNodeOfferingId\fP\&.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Marker \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates the starting point for the next set of response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this returned marker value in the \fBMarker\fP parameter and retrying the command. If the \fBMarker\fP field is empty, all response records have been retrieved for the request.

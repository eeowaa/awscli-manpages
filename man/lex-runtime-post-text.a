.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Sends user input to Amazon Lex. Client applications can use this API to send requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex then interprets the user input using the machine learning model it built for the bot.
.sp
In response, Amazon Lex returns the next \fBmessage\fP to convey to the user an optional \fBresponseCard\fP to display. Consider the following example messages:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For a user input "I would like a pizza", Amazon Lex might return a response with a message eliciting slot data (for example, PizzaSize): "What size pizza would you like?"
.IP \(bu 2
After the user provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon Lex might return a response with a message to obtain user confirmation "Proceed with the pizza order?".
.IP \(bu 2
After the user replies to a confirmation prompt with a "yes", Amazon Lex might return a conclusion statement: "Thank you, your cheese pizza has been ordered.".
.UNINDENT
.sp
Not all Amazon Lex messages require a user response. For example, a conclusion statement does not require a response. Some messages require only a "yes" or "no" user response. In addition to the \fBmessage\fP , Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in the response that you might use to enhance client behavior, for example, to display the appropriate client user interface. These are the \fBslotToElicit\fP , \fBdialogState\fP , \fBintentName\fP , and \fBslots\fP fields in the response. Consider the following examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the following context information:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdialogState\fP set to ElicitSlot
.IP \(bu 2
\fBintentName\fP set to the intent name in the current context
.IP \(bu 2
\fBslotToElicit\fP set to the slot name for which the \fBmessage\fP is eliciting information
.IP \(bu 2
\fBslots\fP set to a map of slots, configured for the intent, with currently known values
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
If the message is a confirmation prompt, the \fBdialogState\fP is set to ConfirmIntent and \fBSlotToElicit\fP is set to null.
.IP \(bu 2
If the message is a clarification prompt (configured for the intent) that indicates that user intent is not understood, the \fBdialogState\fP is set to ElicitIntent and \fBslotToElicit\fP is set to null.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application\-specific \fBsessionAttributes\fP . For more information, see \fI\%Managing Conversation Context\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-bot\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the Amazon Lex bot.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-bot\-alias\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The alias of the Amazon Lex bot.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-user\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the client application user. Amazon Lex uses this to identify a user\(aqs conversation with your bot. At runtime, each request must contain the \fBuserID\fP field.
.sp
To decide the user ID to use for your application, consider the following factors.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBuserID\fP field must not contain any personally identifiable information of the user, for example, name, personal identification numbers, or other end user personal information.
.IP \(bu 2
If you want a user to start a conversation on one device and continue on another device, use a user\-specific identifier.
.IP \(bu 2
If you want the same user to be able to have two independent conversations on two different devices, choose a device\-specific identifier.
.IP \(bu 2
A user can\(aqt have two independent conversations with two different versions of the same bot. For example, a user can\(aqt have a conversation with the PROD and BETA versions of the same bot. If you anticipate that a user will need to have conversation with two different versions, for example, while testing, include the bot alias in the user ID to separate the two conversations.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

slots \-> (map)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The intent slots that Amazon Lex detected from the user input in the conversation.
.sp
Amazon Lex creates a resolution list containing likely values for a slot. The value that it returns is determined by the \fBvalueSelectionStrategy\fP selected when the slot type was created or updated. If \fBvalueSelectionStrategy\fP is set to \fBORIGINAL_VALUE\fP , the value provided by the user is returned, if the user value is similar to the slot values. If \fBvalueSelectionStrategy\fP is set to \fBTOP_RESOLUTION\fP Amazon Lex returns the first value in the resolution list or, if there is no resolution list, null. If you don\(aqt specify a \fBvalueSelectionStrategy\fP , the default is \fBORIGINAL_VALUE\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
message \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The message to convey to the user. The message can come from the bot\(aqs configuration or from a Lambda function.
.sp
If the intent is not configured with a Lambda function, or if the Lambda function returned \fBDelegate\fP as the \fBdialogAction.type\fP its response, Amazon Lex decides on the next course of action and selects an appropriate message from the bot\(aqs configuration based on the current interaction context. For example, if Amazon Lex isn\(aqt able to understand user input, it uses a clarification prompt message.
.sp
When you create an intent you can assign messages to groups. When messages are assigned to groups Amazon Lex returns one message from each group in the response. The message field is an escaped JSON string containing the messages. For more information about the structure of the JSON string returned, see  msg\-prompts\-formats .
.sp
If the Lambda function returns a message, Amazon Lex passes it to the client in its response.

.sp
dialogState \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Identifies the current state of the user interaction. Amazon Lex returns one of the following values as \fBdialogState\fP . The client can optionally use this information to customize the user interface.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBElicitIntent\fP \- Amazon Lex wants to elicit user intent.  For example, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a pizza"). If Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this utterance, it will return this dialogState.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBConfirmIntent\fP \- Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no" response.  For example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling an intent.  Instead of a simple "yes" or "no," a user might respond with additional information. For example, "yes, but make it thick crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink". Amazon Lex can process such additional information (in these examples, update the crust type slot value, or change intent from OrderPizza to OrderDrink).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBElicitSlot\fP \- Amazon Lex is expecting a slot value for the current intent.  For example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this message: "What size pizza would you like?". A user might reply with the slot value (e.g., "medium"). The user might also provide additional information in the response (e.g., "medium thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can process such additional information appropriately.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFulfilled\fP \- Conveys that the Lambda function configured for the intent has successfully fulfilled the intent.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBReadyForFulfillment\fP \- Conveys that the client has to fulfill the intent.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFailed\fP \- Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.  This can happen for various reasons including that the user did not provide an appropriate response to prompts from the service (you can configure how many times Amazon Lex can prompt a user for specific information), or the Lambda function failed to fulfill the intent.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
For a blue/green deployment, starts the process of rerouting traffic from instances in the original environment to instances in the replacement environment without waiting for a specified wait time to elapse. (Traffic rerouting, which is achieved by registering instances in the replacement environment with the load balancer, can start as soon as all instances have a status of Ready.)

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-deployment\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique ID of a blue/green deployment for which you want to start rerouting traffic to the replacement environment.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-deployment\-wait\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the deployment\(aqs waiting period. \fBREADY_WAIT\fP indicates that the deployment is ready to start shifting traffic. \fBTERMINATION_WAIT\fP indicates that the traffic is shifted, but the original target is not terminated.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBREADY_WAIT\fP

\fBTERMINATION_WAIT\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

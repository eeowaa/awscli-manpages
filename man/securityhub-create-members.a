.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified accounts and the account used to make the request, which is the administrator account. If you are integrated with Organizations, then the administrator account is designated by the organization management account.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBCreateMembers\fP is always used to add accounts that are not organization members.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For accounts that are part of an organization, \fBCreateMembers\fP is only used in the following cases:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new accounts in an organization.
.IP \(bu 2
The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the \(ga\(ga  EnableSecurityHub \(ga\(ga operation.
.sp
For accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the \(ga\(ga  InviteMembers \(ga\(ga operation. If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub.
.sp
Accounts that are part of an organization do not receive an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub.
.sp
A permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to view the findings generated in the member account. When Security Hub is enabled in a member account, the member account findings are also visible to the administrator account.
.sp
To remove the association between the administrator and member accounts, use the \(ga\(ga  DisassociateFromMasterAccount \(ga\(ga or \(ga\(ga  DisassociateMembers \(ga\(ga operation.
.sp

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

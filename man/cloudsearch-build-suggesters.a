.sp
\fB\-\-domain\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
FieldNames \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of field names.
.sp
(string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A string that represents the name of an index field. CloudSearch supports regular index fields as well as dynamic fields. A dynamic field\(aqs name defines a pattern that begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document fields that don\(aqt map to a regular index field but do match a dynamic field\(aqs pattern are configured with the dynamic field\(aqs indexing options.
.sp
Regular field names begin with a letter and can contain the following characters: a\-z (lowercase), 0\-9, and _ (underscore). Dynamic field names must begin or end with a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be the only character in a dynamic field name. Multiple wildcards, and wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.
.sp
The name \fBscore\fP is reserved and cannot be used as a field name. To reference a document\(aqs ID, you can use the name \fB_id\fP .

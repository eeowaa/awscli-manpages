.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-subdirectory\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A subdirectory in the location’s path. This subdirectory in the EFS file system is used to read data from the EFS source location or write data to the EFS destination. By default, AWS DataSync uses the root directory.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBSubdirectory\fP must be specified with forward slashes. For example, \fB/path/to/folder\fP .

\fB\-\-efs\-filesystem\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon EFS file system.

.sp
\fB\-\-ec2\-config\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The subnet and security group that the Amazon EFS file system uses. The security group that you provide needs to be able to communicate with the security group on the mount target in the subnet specified.
.sp
The exact relationship between security group M (of the mount target) and security group S (which you provide for DataSync to use at this stage) is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Security group M (which you associate with the mount target) must allow inbound access for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on the NFS port (2049) from security group S. You can enable inbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.
.IP \(bu 2
Security group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have a rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port on one of the file system’s mount targets. You can enable outbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group. For information about security groups and mount targets, see Security Groups for Amazon EC2 Instances and Mount Targets in the \fIAmazon EFS User Guide.\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
SubnetArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the subnet and the security group that DataSync uses to access the target EFS file system.
.UNINDENT

.sp
SecurityGroupArns \-> (list)

\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key\-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the resource. The value can be an empty string. This value helps you manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you create a name tag for your location.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents a single entry in a list of AWS resource tags. \fBTagListEntry\fP returns an array that contains a list of tasks when the \fI\%ListTagsForResource\fP operation is called.
.sp

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
iam-get-organizations-access-report \- Retrieves the service last accessed data report for AWS Organizations that was previously generated using the (ga(ga  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport (ga(ga operation
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the service last accessed data report for AWS Organizations that was previously generated using the \(ga\(ga  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport \(ga\(ga operation. This operation retrieves the status of your report job and the report contents.
.sp
Depending on the parameters that you passed when you generated the report, the data returned could include different information. For details, see  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport .
.sp
To call this operation, you must be signed in to the management account in your organization. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have permissions to perform this operation. For more information, see \fI\%Refining permissions using service last accessed data\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
For each service that principals in an account (root users, IAM users, or IAM roles) could access using SCPs, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, it returns the reason that it failed.
.sp
By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-job\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier of the request generated by the  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport operation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the \fBIsTruncated\fP response element is \fBtrue\fP .
.sp
If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the \fBIsTruncated\fP response element returns \fBtrue\fP , and \fBMarker\fP contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-marker\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the \fBMarker\fP element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-sort\-key\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key that is used to sort the results. If you choose the namespace key, the results are returned in alphabetical order. If you choose the time key, the results are sorted numerically by the date and time.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
Disassociates an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) from an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone. Note the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You can\(aqt disassociate the last Amazon VPC from a private hosted zone.
.IP \(bu 2
You can\(aqt convert a private hosted zone into a public hosted zone.
.IP \(bu 2
You can submit a \fBDisassociateVPCFromHostedZone\fP request using either the account that created the hosted zone or the account that created the Amazon VPC.
.IP \(bu 2
Some services, such as AWS Cloud Map and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) automatically create hosted zones and associate VPCs with the hosted zones. A service can create a hosted zone using your account or using its own account. You can disassociate a VPC from a hosted zone only if the service created the hosted zone using your account. When you run \fI\%DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone\fP , if the hosted zone has a value for \fBOwningAccount\fP , you can use \fBDisassociateVPCFromHostedZone\fP . If the hosted zone has a value for \fBOwningService\fP , you can\(aqt use \fBDisassociateVPCFromHostedZone\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

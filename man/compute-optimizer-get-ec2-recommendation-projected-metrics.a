.SH NAME
compute-optimizer-get-ec2-recommendation-projected-metrics \- Returns the projected utilization metrics of Amazon EC2 instance recommendations
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns the projected utilization metrics of Amazon EC2 instance recommendations.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBCpu\fP and \fBMemory\fP metrics are the only projected utilization metrics returned when you run this action. Additionally, the \fBMemory\fP metric is returned only for resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them. For more information, see \fI\%Enabling Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

The \fBCpu\fP and \fBMemory\fP metrics are the only projected utilization metrics returned when you run the \fBGetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics\fP action. Additionally, the \fBMemory\fP metric is returned only for resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them.

.INDENT 3.5
The recommended instance type.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
rank \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The rank of the recommendation option projected metric.
.sp
The top recommendation option is ranked as \fB1\fP .
.sp
The projected metric rank correlates to the recommendation option rank. For example, the projected metric ranked as \fB1\fP is related to the recommendation option that is also ranked as \fB1\fP in the same response.

.INDENT 3.5
Describes a projected utilization metric of a recommendation option, such as an Amazon EC2 instance. This represents the projected utilization of a recommendation option had you used that resource during the analyzed period.
.sp
Compare the utilization metric data of your resource against its projected utilization metric data to determine the performance difference between your current resource and the recommended option.

name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the projected utilization metric.
.sp
The following projected utilization metrics are returned:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCpu\fP \- The projected percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that would be in use on the recommendation option had you used that resource during the analyzed period. This metric identifies the processing power required to run an application on the recommendation option. Depending on the instance type, tools in your operating system can show a lower percentage than CloudWatch when the instance is not allocated a full processor core. Units: Percent
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMemory\fP \- The percentage of memory that would be in use on the recommendation option had you used that resource during the analyzed period. This metric identifies the amount of memory required to run an application on the recommendation option. Units: Percent

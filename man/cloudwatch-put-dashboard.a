.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing dashboard. If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced with what you specify here.
.sp
All dashboards in your account are global, not region\-specific.
.sp
A simple way to create a dashboard using \fBPutDashboard\fP is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use \fBGetDashboard\fP , and then use the data returned within \fBDashboardBody\fP as the template for the new dashboard when you call \fBPutDashboard\fP .
.sp
When you create a dashboard with \fBPutDashboard\fP , a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the \fBDashboardBody\fP script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-dashboard\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the dashboard. If a dashboard with this name already exists, this call modifies that dashboard, replacing its current contents. Otherwise, a new dashboard is created. The maximum length is 255, and valid characters are A\-Z, a\-z, 0\-9, "\-", and "_". This parameter is required.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-dashboard\-body\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The detailed information about the dashboard in JSON format, including the widgets to include and their location on the dashboard. This parameter is required.
.sp
For more information about the syntax, see \fI\%Dashboard Body Structure and Syntax\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

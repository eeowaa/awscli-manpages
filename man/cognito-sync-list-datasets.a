.SH NAME
cognito-sync-list-datasets \- Lists datasets for an identity
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists datasets for an identity. With Amazon Cognito Sync, each identity has access only to its own data. Thus, the credentials used to make this API call need to have access to the identity data.
.sp
ListDatasets can be called with temporary user credentials provided by Cognito Identity or with developer credentials. You should use the Cognito Identity credentials to make this API call.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-identity\-pool\-id\fP (string)
A name\-spaced GUID (for example, us\-east\-1:23EC4050\-6AEA\-7089\-A2DD\-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.
.sp
\fB\-\-identity\-id\fP (string)
A name\-spaced GUID (for example, us\-east\-1:23EC4050\-6AEA\-7089\-A2DD\-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
A pagination token for obtaining the next page of results.
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
The maximum number of results to be returned.
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Datasets \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A set of datasets.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A collection of data for an identity pool. An identity pool can have multiple datasets. A dataset is per identity and can be general or associated with a particular entity in an application (like a saved game). Datasets are automatically created if they don\(aqt exist. Data is synced by dataset, and a dataset can hold up to 1MB of key\-value pairs.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
A name\-spaced GUID (for example, us\-east\-1:23EC4050\-6AEA\-7089\-A2DD\-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

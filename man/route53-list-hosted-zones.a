.SH NAME
route53-list-hosted-zones \- Retrieves a list of the public and private hosted zones that are associated with the current AWS account
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves a list of the public and private hosted zones that are associated with the current AWS account. The response includes a \fBHostedZones\fP child element for each hosted zone.
.sp
Amazon Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, you can use the \fBmaxitems\fP parameter to list them in groups of up to 100.
.sp

See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBlist\-hosted\-zones\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBHostedZones\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-delegation\-set\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you\(aqre using reusable delegation sets and you want to list all of the hosted zones that are associated with a reusable delegation set, specify the ID of that reusable delegation set.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo list the hosted zones associated with the current AWS account\fP
.sp
The following \fBlist\-hosted\-zones\fP command lists summary information about the first 100 hosted zones that are associated with the current AWS account.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws route53 list\-hosted\-zones
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you have more than 100 hosted zones, or if you want to list them in groups smaller than 100, include the \fB\-\-max\-items\fP parameter. For example, to list hosted zones one at a time, use the following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws route53 list\-hosted\-zones \-\-max\-items 1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To view information about the next hosted zone, take the value of \fBNextToken\fP from the response to the previous command, and include it in the \fB\-\-starting\-token\fP parameter, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Provides organization conformance pack deployment status for an organization.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status is not considered successful until organization conformance pack is successfully deployed in all the member accounts with an exception of excluded accounts.
.sp
When you specify the limit and the next token, you receive a paginated response. Limit and next token are not applicable if you specify organization conformance pack names. They are only applicable, when you request all the organization conformance packs.

\fBdescribe\-organization\-conformance\-pack\-statuses\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBOrganizationConformancePackStatuses\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
OrganizationConformancePackStatuses \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of \fBOrganizationConformancePackStatus\fP objects.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns the status for an organization conformance pack in an organization.
.sp
OrganizationConformancePackName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name that you assign to organization conformance pack.
.UNINDENT

.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates deployment status of an organization conformance pack. When master account calls PutOrganizationConformancePack for the first time, conformance pack status is created in all the member accounts. When master account calls PutOrganizationConformancePack for the second time, conformance pack status is updated in all the member accounts. Additionally, conformance pack status is updated when one or more member accounts join or leave an organization. Conformance pack status is deleted when the master account deletes OrganizationConformancePack in all the member accounts and disables service access for \fBconfig\-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com\fP .
.sp
AWS Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATE_SUCCESSFUL\fP when an organization conformance pack has been successfully created in all the member accounts.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATE_IN_PROGRESS\fP when an organization conformance pack creation is in progress.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATE_FAILED\fP when an organization conformance pack creation failed in one or more member accounts within that organization.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETE_FAILED\fP when an organization conformance pack deletion failed in one or more member accounts within that organization.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETE_IN_PROGRESS\fP when an organization conformance pack deletion is in progress.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETE_SUCCESSFUL\fP when an organization conformance pack has been successfully deleted from all the member accounts.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUPDATE_SUCCESSFUL\fP when an organization conformance pack has been successfully updated in all the member accounts.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUPDATE_IN_PROGRESS\fP when an organization conformance pack update is in progress.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUPDATE_FAILED\fP when an organization conformance pack update failed in one or more member accounts within that organization.

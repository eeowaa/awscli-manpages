.SH NAME
fsx-create-file-system \- Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system.
.sp
If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, \fBCreateFileSystem\fP returns the description of the existing file system. If a file system specified client request token exists and the parameters don\(aqt match, this call returns \fBIncompatibleParameterError\fP . If a file system with the specified client request token doesn\(aqt exist, \fBCreateFileSystem\fP does the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of \fBCREATING\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
Returns the description of the file system.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation requires a client request token in the request that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent creation. This means that calling the operation multiple times with the same client request token has no effect. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a \fBCreateFileSystem\fP operation without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBCreateFileSystem\fP call returns while the file system\(aqs lifecycle state is still \fBCREATING\fP . You can check the file\-system creation status by calling the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.

ImportPath \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) The path to the Amazon S3 bucket (including the optional prefix) that you\(aqre using as the data repository for your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. The root of your FSx for Lustre file system will be mapped to the root of the Amazon S3 bucket you select. An example is \fBs3://import\-bucket/optional\-prefix\fP . If you specify a prefix after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the file system.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ExportPath \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) The path in Amazon S3 where the root of your Amazon FSx file system is exported. The path must use the same Amazon S3 bucket as specified in ImportPath. You can provide an optional prefix to which new and changed data is to be exported from your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. If an \fBExportPath\fP value is not provided, Amazon FSx sets a default export path, \fBs3://import\-bucket/FSxLustre[creation\-timestamp]\fP . The timestamp is in UTC format, for example \fBs3://import\-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z\fP .
.sp
The Amazon S3 export bucket must be the same as the import bucket specified by \fBImportPath\fP . If you only specify a bucket name, such as \fBs3://import\-bucket\fP , you get a 1:1 mapping of file system objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the input data in S3 is overwritten on export. If you provide a custom prefix in the export path, such as \fBs3://import\-bucket/[custom\-optional\-prefix]\fP , Amazon FSx exports the contents of your file system to that export prefix in the Amazon S3 bucket.

The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.
.sp
The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) When you create your file system, your existing S3 objects appear as file and directory listings.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBNONE\fP \- (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates file and directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the file system is created. FSx does not update file and directory listings for any new or changed objects after choosing this option.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Required for the \fBPERSISTENT_1\fP deployment type, describes the amount of read and write throughput for each 1 tebibyte of storage, in MB/s/TiB. File system throughput capacity is calculated by multiplying ﬁle system storage capacity (TiB) by the PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). For a 2.4 TiB ﬁle system, provisioning 50 MB/s/TiB of PerUnitStorageThroughput yields 120 MB/s of ﬁle system throughput. You pay for the amount of throughput that you provision.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Not available to use with file systems that are linked to a data repository. A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file system should be copied to backups. The default value is false. If it\(aqs set to true, all file system tags are copied to all automatic and user\-initiated backups when the user doesn\(aqt specify any backup\-specific tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more backup tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups.

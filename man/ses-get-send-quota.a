.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

   "MaxSendRate": 1.0
}

Max24HourSend is your sending quota, which is the maximum number of emails that you can send in a 24\-hour period.
The sending quota reflects a rolling time period. Every time you try to send an email, Amazon SES checks how many
emails you sent in the previous 24 hours. As long as the total number of emails that you have sent is less than
your quota, your send request will be accepted and your email will be sent.
.sp
SentLast24Hours is the number of emails that you have sent in the previous 24 hours.
.sp
MaxSendRate is the maximum number of emails that you can send per second.
.sp
Note that sending limits are based on recipients rather than on messages. For example, an email that has 10 recipients
counts as 10 against your sending quota.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits\fP in the \fIAmazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide\fP\&.

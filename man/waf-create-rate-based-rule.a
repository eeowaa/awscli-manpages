\fBFor the latest version of AWS WAF\fP , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the \fI\%AWS WAF Developer Guide\fP . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

Creates a  RateBasedRule . The \fBRateBasedRule\fP contains a \fBRateLimit\fP , which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five\-minute period. The \fBRateBasedRule\fP also contains the \fBIPSet\fP objects, \fBByteMatchSet\fP objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the \fBRateLimit\fP .
.sp
If you add more than one predicate to a \fBRateBasedRule\fP , a request not only must exceed the \fBRateLimit\fP , but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a \fBRateBasedRule\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An \fBIPSet\fP that matches the IP address \fB192.0.2.44/32\fP
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBByteMatchSet\fP that matches \fBBadBot\fP in the \fBUser\-Agent\fP header
.UNINDENT
.sp
Further, you specify a \fBRateLimit\fP of 1,000.
.sp
You then add the \fBRateBasedRule\fP to a \fBWebACL\fP and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 \fIand\fP the \fBUser\-Agent\fP header in the request must contain the value \fBBadBot\fP . Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five\-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.
.sp
As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a \fBRateBasedRule\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBByteMatchSet\fP with \fBFieldToMatch\fP of \fBURI\fP
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBPositionalConstraint\fP of \fBSTARTS_WITH\fP
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBTargetString\fP of \fBlogin\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Further, you specify a \fBRateLimit\fP of 1,000.
.sp
By adding this \fBRateBasedRule\fP to a \fBWebACL\fP , you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site.
.sp
To create and configure a \fBRateBasedRule\fP , perform the following steps:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the rule. For more information, see  CreateByteMatchSet ,  CreateIPSet , and  CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet .
.IP \(bu 2
Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the \fBChangeToken\fP parameter of a \fBCreateRule\fP request.
.IP \(bu 2
Submit a \fBCreateRateBasedRule\fP request.
.IP \(bu 2
Use \fBGetChangeToken\fP to get the change token that you provide in the \fBChangeToken\fP parameter of an  UpdateRule request.
.IP \(bu 2
Submit an \fBUpdateRateBasedRule\fP request to specify the predicates that you want to include in the rule.
.IP \(bu 2
Create and update a \fBWebACL\fP that contains the \fBRateBasedRule\fP . For more information, see  CreateWebACL .

\fB\-\-rate\-key\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are likely arriving from a single source and thus subject to rate monitoring. The only valid value for \fBRateKey\fP is \fBIP\fP . \fBIP\fP indicates that requests that arrive from the same IP address are subject to the \fBRateLimit\fP that is specified in the \fBRateBasedRule\fP .

\fB\-\-rate\-limit\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the field that is specified by \fBRateKey\fP , allowed in a five\-minute period. If the number of requests exceeds the \fBRateLimit\fP and the other predicates specified in the rule are also met, AWS WAF triggers the action that is specified for this rule.

A tag associated with an AWS resource. Tags are key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and manage your resources, for purposes like billing. For example, you might set the tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You can specify one or more tags to add to each AWS resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.
.sp
Tagging is only available through the API, SDKs, and CLI. You can\(aqt manage or view tags through the AWS WAF Classic console. You can tag the AWS resources that you manage through AWS WAF Classic: web ACLs, rule groups, and rules.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Specifies the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , and  SizeConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a \fBRule\fP and, for each object, indicates whether you want to negate the settings, for example, requests that do NOT originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44.

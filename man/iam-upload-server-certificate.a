.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Uploads a server certificate entity for the AWS account. The server certificate entity includes a public key certificate, a private key, and an optional certificate chain, which should all be PEM\-encoded.
.sp
We recommend that you use \fI\%AWS Certificate Manager\fP to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate, deploy it to AWS resources, and let ACM handle certificate renewals for you. Certificates provided by ACM are free. For more information about using ACM, see the \fI\%AWS Certificate Manager User Guide\fP .
.sp
For more information about working with server certificates, see \fI\%Working with server certificates\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . This topic includes a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.
.sp
For information about the number of server certificates you can upload, see \fI\%IAM and STS quotas\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

Because the body of the public key certificate, private key, and the certificate chain can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling \fBUploadServerCertificate\fP . For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see \fI\%Signing AWS API requests\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP . For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see \fI\%Calling the API by making HTTP query requests\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

The path for the server certificate. For more information about paths, see \fI\%IAM identifiers\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\fB\eu0021\fP ) through the DEL character (\fB\eu007F\fP ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
If you are uploading a server certificate specifically for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions, you must specify a path using the \fBpath\fP parameter. The path must begin with \fB/cloudfront\fP and must include a trailing slash (for example, \fB/cloudfront/test/\fP ).

\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM server certificate resource. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of \fBDepartment\fP could have values such as \fBHuman Resources\fP , \fBAccounting\fP , and \fBSupport\fP . Tags with a key name of \fBCost Center\fP might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AWS always interprets the tag \fBValue\fP as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma\-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo upload a server certificate to your AWS account\fP
.sp
The following \fBupload\-server\-certificate\fP command uploads a server certificate to your AWS account. In this example, the certificate is in the file \fBpublic_key_cert_file.pem\fP, the associated private key is in the file \fBmy_private_key.pem\fP, and the the certificate chain provided by the certificate authority (CA) is in the \fBmy_certificate_chain_file.pem\fP file. When the file has finished uploading, it is available under the name \fImyServerCertificate\fP\&. Parameters that begin with \fBfile://\fP tells the command to read the contents of the file and use that as the parameter value instead of the file name itself.

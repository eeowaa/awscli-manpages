.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to continue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the next set of pages, pass in the \fBNextToken\fP from the response object of the previous page call.

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
EngineVersions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of engine versions that are available to choose from.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Athena engine version for running queries.
.sp
SelectedEngineVersion \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The engine version requested by the user. Possible values are determined by the output of \fBListEngineVersions\fP , including Auto. The default is Auto.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EffectiveEngineVersion \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If the user requests a valid engine version other than Auto, the effective engine version is the same as the engine version that the user requested. If the user requests Auto, the effective engine version is chosen by Athena. When a request to update the engine version is made by a \fBCreateWorkGroup\fP or \fBUpdateWorkGroup\fP operation, the \fBEffectiveEngineVersion\fP field is ignored.

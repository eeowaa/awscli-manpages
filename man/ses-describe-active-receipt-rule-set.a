.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
(structure)

.INDENT 3.5
Receipt rules enable you to specify which actions Amazon SES should take when it receives mail on behalf of one or more email addresses or domains that you own.
.sp
Each receipt rule defines a set of email addresses or domains that it applies to. If the email addresses or domains match at least one recipient address of the message, Amazon SES executes all of the receipt rule\(aqs actions on the message.

The ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to notify when the message is saved to the Amazon S3 bucket. An example of an Amazon SNS topic ARN is \fBarn:aws:sns:us\-west\-2:123456789012:MyTopic\fP . For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the \fI\%Amazon SNS Developer Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ObjectKeyPrefix \-> (string)

.sp
KmsKeyArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The customer master key that Amazon SES should use to encrypt your emails before saving them to the Amazon S3 bucket. You can use the default master key or a custom master key you created in AWS KMS as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To use the default master key, provide an ARN in the form of \fBarn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT\-ID\-WITHOUT\-HYPHENS:alias/aws/ses\fP . For example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the default master key in the US West (Oregon) region, the ARN of the default master key would be \fBarn:aws:kms:us\-west\-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses\fP . If you use the default master key, you don\(aqt need to perform any extra steps to give Amazon SES permission to use the key.
.IP \(bu 2
To use a custom master key you created in AWS KMS, provide the ARN of the master key and ensure that you add a statement to your key\(aqs policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more information about giving permissions, see the \fI\%Amazon SES Developer Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more information about key policies, see the \fI\%AWS KMS Developer Guide\fP . If you do not specify a master key, Amazon SES will not encrypt your emails.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Your mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption client before the mail is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is not encrypted using Amazon S3 server\-side encryption. This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to use your AWS KMS keys for decryption. This encryption client is currently available with the \fI\%AWS SDK for Java\fP and \fI\%AWS SDK for Ruby\fP only. For more information about client\-side encryption using AWS KMS master keys, see the \fI\%Amazon S3 Developer Guide\fP .

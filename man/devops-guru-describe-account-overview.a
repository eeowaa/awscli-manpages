.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-from\-time\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The start of the time range passed in. The start time granularity is at the day level. The floor of the start time is used. Returned information occurred after this day.

.sp
\fB\-\-to\-time\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The end of the time range passed in. The start time granularity is at the day level. The floor of the start time is used. Returned information occurred before this day. If this is not specified, then the current day is used.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

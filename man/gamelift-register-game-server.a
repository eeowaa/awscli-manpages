.SH DESCRIPTION
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBThis operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift FleetIQ that the game server is ready to host gameplay and players. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group. Registering game servers enables GameLift FleetIQ to track available game servers and enables game clients and services to claim a game server for a new game session.
.sp
To register a game server, identify the game server group and instance where the game server is running, and provide a unique identifier for the game server. You can also include connection and game server data. When a game client or service requests a game server by calling  ClaimGameServer , this information is returned in the response.
.sp
Once a game server is successfully registered, it is put in status \fBAVAILABLE\fP . A request to register a game server may fail if the instance it is running on is in the process of shutting down as part of instance balancing or scale\-down activity.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-game\-server\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the game server group where the game server is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-game\-server\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server to register. Game server IDs are developer\-defined and must be unique across all game server groups in your AWS account.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-instance\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the instance where the game server is running. This ID is available in the instance metadata. EC2 instance IDs use a 17\-character format, for example: \fBi\-1234567890abcdef0\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-connection\-info\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Information that is needed to make inbound client connections to the game server. This might include the IP address and port, DNS name, and other information.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-game\-server\-data\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game client or service when it requests information on game servers using  ListGameServers or  ClaimGameServer .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

ClaimStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates when an available game server has been reserved for gameplay but has not yet started hosting a game. Once it is claimed, the game server remains in \fBCLAIMED\fP status for a maximum of one minute. During this time, game clients connect to the game server to start the game and trigger the game server to update its utilization status. After one minute, the game server claim status reverts to null.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
UtilizationStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new games or is busy. Possible statuses include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAVAILABLE\fP \- The game server is available to be claimed. A game server that has been claimed remains in this status until it reports game hosting activity.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUTILIZED\fP \- The game server is currently hosting a game session with players.

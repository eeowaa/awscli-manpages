.SH OPTIONS

\fB\-\-agent\-ids\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The IDs of the agents or connectors from which to start collecting data. If you send a request to an agent/connector ID that you do not have permission to contact, according to your AWS account, the service does not throw an exception. Instead, it returns the error in the \fIDescription\fP field. If you send a request to multiple agents/connectors and you do not have permission to contact some of those agents/connectors, the system does not throw an exception. Instead, the system shows \fBFailed\fP in the \fIDescription\fP field.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

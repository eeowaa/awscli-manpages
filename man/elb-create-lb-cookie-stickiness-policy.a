.SH NAME
elb-create-lb-cookie-stickiness-policy \- Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes controlled by the lifetime of the browser (user-agent) or a specified expiration period
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes controlled by the lifetime of the browser (user\-agent) or a specified expiration period. This policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.
.sp
When a load balancer implements this policy, the load balancer uses a special cookie to track the instance for each request. When the load balancer receives a request, it first checks to see if this cookie is present in the request. If so, the load balancer sends the request to the application server specified in the cookie. If not, the load balancer sends the request to a server that is chosen based on the existing load\-balancing algorithm.
.sp
A cookie is inserted into the response for binding subsequent requests from the same user to that server. The validity of the cookie is based on the cookie expiration time, which is specified in the policy configuration.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Duration\-Based Session Stickiness\fP in the \fIClassic Load Balancers Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-load\-balancer\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the load balancer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-policy\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the policy being created. Policy names must consist of alphanumeric characters and dashes (\-). This name must be unique within the set of policies for this load balancer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cookie\-expiration\-period\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The time period, in seconds, after which the cookie should be considered stale. If you do not specify this parameter, the default value is 0, which indicates that the sticky session should last for the duration of the browser session.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

route53resolver-list-resolver-query-log-configs \- Lists information about the specified query logging configurations
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists information about the specified query logging configurations. Each configuration defines where you want Resolver to save DNS query logs and specifies the VPCs that you want to log queries for.

\fBlist\-resolver\-query\-log\-configs\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBResolverQueryLogConfigs\fP

For Resolver list operations (\fI\%ListResolverEndpoints\fP , \fI\%ListResolverRules\fP , \fI\%ListResolverRuleAssociations\fP , \fI\%ListResolverQueryLogConfigs\fP , \fI\%ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations\fP ), and \fI\%ListResolverDnssecConfigs\fP ), an optional specification to return a subset of objects.
.sp
To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules, you specify \fBName\fP and \fBValues\fP . For example, to list only inbound Resolver endpoints, specify \fBDirection\fP for \fBName\fP and specify \fBINBOUND\fP for \fBValues\fP .
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter objects.

The valid values for \fBName\fP depend on the action that you\(aqre including the filter in, \fI\%ListResolverEndpoints\fP , \fI\%ListResolverRules\fP , \fI\%ListResolverRuleAssociations\fP , \fI\%ListResolverQueryLogConfigs\fP , or \fI\%ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations\fP .

In early versions of Resolver, values for \fBName\fP were listed as uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters. For example, \fBCreatorRequestId\fP was originally listed as \fBCREATOR_REQUEST_ID\fP . Uppercase values for \fBName\fP are still supported.

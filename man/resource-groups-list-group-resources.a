\fBlist\-group\-resources\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBResourceIdentifiers\fP, \fBResources\fP

\fB\-\-filters\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Filters, formatted as  ResourceFilter objects, that you want to apply to a \fBListGroupResources\fP operation. Filters the results to include only those of the specified resource types.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBresource\-type\fP \- Filter resources by their type. Specify up to five resource types in the format \fBAWS::ServiceCode::ResourceType\fP . For example, \fBAWS::EC2::Instance\fP , or \fBAWS::S3::Bucket\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
When you specify a \fBresource\-type\fP filter for \fBListGroupResources\fP , AWS Resource Groups validates your filter resource types against the types that are defined in the query associated with the group. For example, if a group contains only S3 buckets because its query specifies only that resource type, but your \fBresource\-type\fP filter includes EC2 instances, AWS Resource Groups does not filter for EC2 instances. In this case, a \fBListGroupResources\fP request returns a \fBBadRequestException\fP error with a message similar to the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBThe resource types specified as filters in the request are not valid.\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The error includes a list of resource types that failed the validation because they are not part of the query associated with the group. This validation doesn\(aqt occur when the group query specifies \fBAWS::AllSupported\fP , because a group based on such a query can contain any of the allowed resource types for the query type (tag\-based or AWS CloudFormation stack\-based queries).

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBdescribe\-db\-proxy\-target\-groups\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBTargetGroups\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
TargetGroups \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An arbitrary number of \fBDBProxyTargetGroup\fP objects, containing details of the corresponding target groups.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents a set of RDS DB instances, Aurora DB clusters, or both that a proxy can connect to. Currently, each target group is associated with exactly one RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster.
.sp
This data type is used as a response element in the \fBDescribeDBProxyTargetGroups\fP action.
.sp
DBProxyName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier for the RDS proxy associated with this target group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
TargetGroupName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier for the target group. This name must be unique for all target groups owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
TargetGroupArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the target group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
IsDefault \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Whether this target group is the first one used for connection requests by the associated proxy. Because each proxy is currently associated with a single target group, currently this setting is always \fBtrue\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The current status of this target group. A status of \fBavailable\fP means the target group is correctly associated with a database. Other values indicate that you must wait for the target group to be ready, or take some action to resolve an issue.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ConnectionPoolConfig \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The settings that determine the size and behavior of the connection pool for the target group.
.sp
MaxConnectionsPercent \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the \fBmax_connections\fP setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MaxIdleConnectionsPercent \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the \fBmax_connections\fP setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ConnectionBorrowTimeout \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SessionPinningFilters \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Currently, the only allowed value is \fBEXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS\fP .
.sp
(string)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
InitQuery \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with \fBSET\fP statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. This setting is empty by default. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single \fBSET\fP statement, such as \fBSET x=1, y=2\fP .

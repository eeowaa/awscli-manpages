.SH NAME
sagemaker-delete-endpoint-config \- Deletes an endpoint configuration
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes an endpoint configuration. The \fBDeleteEndpointConfig\fP API deletes only the specified configuration. It does not delete endpoints created using the configuration.
.sp
You must not delete an \fBEndpointConfig\fP in use by an endpoint that is live or while the \fBUpdateEndpoint\fP or \fBCreateEndpoint\fP operations are being performed on the endpoint. If you delete the \fBEndpointConfig\fP of an endpoint that is active or being created or updated you may lose visibility into the instance type the endpoint is using. The endpoint must be deleted in order to stop incurring charges.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

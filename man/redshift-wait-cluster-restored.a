.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Wait until JMESPath query Clusters[].RestoreStatus.Status returns completed for all elements when polling with \fBdescribe\-clusters\fP\&. It will poll every 60 seconds until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255 after 30 failed checks.

\fBcluster\-restored\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBClusters\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cluster\-identifier\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier of a cluster whose properties you are requesting. This parameter is case sensitive.
.sp
The default is that all clusters defined for an account are returned.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-tag\-keys\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching clusters that are associated with the specified key or keys. For example, suppose that you have clusters that are tagged with keys called \fBowner\fP and \fBenvironment\fP . If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the clusters that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

.INDENT 3.5
A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching clusters that are associated with the specified tag value or values. For example, suppose that you have clusters that are tagged with values called \fBadmin\fP and \fBtest\fP . If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the clusters that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBTo wait for cluster to be restored\fP
.sp
The following \fBwait cluster\-restored\fP example pauses and resumes only after the CLI can confirm that the specified cluster is restored.

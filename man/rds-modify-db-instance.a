\fB\-\-multi\-az\fP | \fB\-\-no\-multi\-az\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates whether the DB instance is a Multi\-AZ deployment. Changing this parameter doesn\(aqt result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the \fBApplyImmediately\fP parameter is enabled for this request.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-engine\-version\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing this parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the \fBApplyImmediately\fP parameter is enabled for this request.
.sp
For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB parameter group is currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family.
.sp
If you specify only a major version, Amazon RDS will update the DB instance to the default minor version if the current minor version is lower. For information about valid engine versions, see \fBCreateDBInstance\fP , or call \fBDescribeDBEngineVersions\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-allow\-major\-version\-upgrade\fP | \fB\-\-no\-allow\-major\-version\-upgrade\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter doesn\(aqt result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
.sp
Constraints: Major version upgrades must be allowed when specifying a value for the EngineVersion parameter that is a different major version than the DB instance\(aqs current version.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-auto\-minor\-version\-upgrade\fP | \fB\-\-no\-auto\-minor\-version\-upgrade\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates whether minor version upgrades are applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window. Changing this parameter doesn\(aqt result in an outage except in the following case and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. An outage results if this parameter is enabled during the maintenance window, and a newer minor version is available, and RDS has enabled auto patching for that engine version.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-license\-model\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The license model for the DB instance.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-iops\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS instance.
.sp
Changing this setting doesn\(aqt result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the \fBApplyImmediately\fP parameter is enabled for this request. If you are migrating from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0. The DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to take effect.
.sp
If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.
.sp
Constraints: For MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, the value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-option\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates the DB instance should be associated with the specified option group. Changing this parameter doesn\(aqt result in an outage except in the following case and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the \fBApplyImmediately\fP parameter is enabled for this request. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, this change can cause a brief (sub\-second) period during which new connections are rejected but existing connections are not interrupted.
.sp
Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can\(aqt be removed from an option group, and that option group can\(aqt be removed from a DB instance once it is associated with a DB instance
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-new\-db\-instance\-identifier\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The new DB instance identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance reboot occurs immediately if you enable \fBApplyImmediately\fP , or will occur during the next maintenance window if you disable Apply Immediately. This value is stored as a lowercase string.
.sp
Constraints:

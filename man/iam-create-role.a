.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-path\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path to the role. For more information about paths, see \fI\%IAM Identifiers\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\fB\eu0021\fP ) through the DEL character (\fB\eu007F\fP ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-role\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the role to create.
.sp
IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-assume\-role\-policy\-document\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The trust relationship policy document that grants an entity permission to assume the role.
.sp
In IAM, you must provide a JSON policy that has been converted to a string. However, for AWS CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. AWS CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\fB\eu0020\fP ) through the end of the ASCII character range
.IP \(bu 2
The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin\-1 Supplement character set (through \fB\eu00FF\fP )
.IP \(bu 2
The special characters tab (\fB\eu0009\fP ), line feed (\fB\eu000A\fP ), and carriage return (\fB\eu000D\fP )
.UNINDENT
.sp
Upon success, the response includes the same trust policy in JSON format.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-description\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A description of the role.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-session\-duration\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default maximum of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.
.sp
Anyone who assumes the role from the AWS CLI or API can use the \fBDurationSeconds\fP API parameter or the \fBduration\-seconds\fP CLI parameter to request a longer session. The \fBMaxSessionDuration\fP setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the \fBDurationSeconds\fP parameter. If users don\(aqt specify a value for the \fBDurationSeconds\fP parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the \fBAssumeRole*\fP API operations or the \fBassume\-role*\fP CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see \fI\%Using IAM roles\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-permissions\-boundary\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the role.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of tags that you want to attach to the new role. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that represents user\-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, \fBDepartment\fP or \fBCost Center\fP are common choices.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of \fBDepartment\fP could have values such as \fBHuman Resources\fP , \fBAccounting\fP , and \fBSupport\fP . Tags with a key name of \fBCost Center\fP might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AWS always interprets the tag \fBValue\fP as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma\-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

The trust policy is defined as a JSON document in the \fITest\-Role\-Trust\-Policy.json\fP file. (The file name and extension do not have significance.) The trust policy must specify a principal.
.sp
To attach a permissions policy to a role, use the \fBput\-role\-policy\fP command.

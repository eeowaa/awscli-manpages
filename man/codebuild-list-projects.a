\fBlist\-projects\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBprojects\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The criterion to be used to list build project names. Valid values include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATED_TIME\fP : List based on when each build project was created.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBLAST_MODIFIED_TIME\fP : List based on when information about each build project was last changed.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBNAME\fP : List based on each build project\(aqs name.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use \fBsortOrder\fP to specify in what order to list the build project names based on the preceding criteria.

.IP \(bu 2
\fBASCENDING\fP : List in ascending order.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDESCENDING\fP : List in descending order.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo get a list of AWS CodeBuild build project names.\fP
.sp
The following \fBlist\-projects\fP example gets a list of CodeBuild build projects sorted by name in ascending order.

Run this command again and provide the \fBnextToken\fP value from the previous response as a parameter to get the next part of the output. Repeat until you don\(aqt receive a \fBnextToken\fP value in the response.

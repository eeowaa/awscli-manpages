.SH NAME
alexaforbusiness-resolve-room \- Determines the details for the room from which a skill request was invoked
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Determines the details for the room from which a skill request was invoked. This operation is used by skill developers.
.sp
To query ResolveRoom from an Alexa skill, the skill ID needs to be authorized. When the skill is using an AWS Lambda function, the skill is automatically authorized when you publish your skill as a private skill to your AWS account. Skills that are hosted using a custom web service must be manually authorized. To get your skill authorized, contact AWS Support with your AWS account ID that queries the ResolveRoom API and skill ID.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
fsx-list-tags-for-resource \- Lists tags for an Amazon FSx file systems and backups in the case of Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists tags for an Amazon FSx file systems and backups in the case of Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.
.sp
When retrieving all tags, you can optionally specify the \fBMaxResults\fP parameter to limit the number of tags in a response. If more tags remain, Amazon FSx returns a \fBNextToken\fP value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the \fBNextToken\fP request parameter set to the value of \fBNextToken\fP from the last response.
.sp
This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your tags. \fBListTagsForResource\fP is called first without a \fBNextToken\fP value. Then the action continues to be called with the \fBNextToken\fP parameter set to the value of the last \fBNextToken\fP value until a response has no \fBNextToken\fP .
.sp
When using this action, keep the following in mind:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The implementation might return fewer than \fBMaxResults\fP file system descriptions while still including a \fBNextToken\fP value.
.IP \(bu 2
The order of tags returned in the response of one \fBListTagsForResource\fP call and the order of tags returned across the responses of a multi\-call iteration is unspecified.

\fBlist\-tags\-for\-resource\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBTags\fP

\fB\-\-resource\-arn\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the Amazon FSx resource that will have its tags listed.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Specifies a key\-value pair for a resource tag.
.sp
Key \-> (string)

Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that specifies the \fBTagValue\fP , the value assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and don\(aqt have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key\-value pair in a tag set of \fBfinances : April\fP and also of \fBpayroll : April\fP .

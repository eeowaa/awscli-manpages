.SH NAME
forecast-delete-resource-tree \- Deletes an entire resource tree
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes an entire resource tree. This operation will delete the parent resource and its child resources.
.sp
Child resources are resources that were created from another resource. For example, when a forecast is generated from a predictor, the forecast is the child resource and the predictor is the parent resource.
.sp
Amazon Forecast resources possess the following parent\-child resource hierarchies:
.INDENT 0.0

\fBDataset\fP : dataset import jobs
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDataset Group\fP : predictors, predictor backtest export jobs, forecasts, forecast export jobs

.IP \(bu 2
\fBForecast\fP : forecast export jobs

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

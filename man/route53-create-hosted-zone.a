.SH NAME
route53-create-hosted-zone \- Creates a new public or private hosted zone
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new public or private hosted zone. You create records in a public hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic on the internet for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (apex.example.com, acme.example.com). You create records in a private hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs).
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You can\(aqt convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new resource record sets.

.sp
For more information about charges for hosted zones, see \fI\%Amazon Route 53 Pricing\fP .
.sp
Note the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You can\(aqt create a hosted zone for a top\-level domain (TLD) such as .com.
.IP \(bu 2
For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record and four NS records for the zone. For more information about SOA and NS records, see \fI\%NS and SOA Records that Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone\fP in the \fIAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide\fP . If you want to use the same name servers for multiple public hosted zones, you can optionally associate a reusable delegation set with the hosted zone. See the \fBDelegationSetId\fP element.
.IP \(bu 2
If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53, you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53 the DNS service for the domain. For more information, see \fI\%Migrating DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53\fP in the \fIAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
When you submit a \fBCreateHostedZone\fP request, the initial status of the hosted zone is \fBPENDING\fP . For public hosted zones, this means that the NS and SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS and SOA records are available, the status of the zone changes to \fBINSYNC\fP .
.sp
The \fBCreateHostedZone\fP request requires the caller to have an \fBec2:DescribeVpcs\fP permission.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the domain. Specify a fully qualified domain name, for example, \fIwww.example.com\fP . The trailing dot is optional; Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain name is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats \fIwww.example.com\fP (without a trailing dot) and \fIwww.example.com.\fP (with a trailing dot) as identical.
.sp
If you\(aqre creating a public hosted zone, this is the name you have registered with your DNS registrar. If your domain name is registered with a registrar other than Route 53, change the name servers for your domain to the set of \fBNameServers\fP that \fBCreateHostedZone\fP returns in \fBDelegationSet\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBlist\-stack\-set\-operation\-results\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBSummaries\fP

\fB\-\-stack\-set\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to get operation results for.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-operation\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the stack set operation.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-call\-as\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
[Service\-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization\(aqs management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.
.sp
By default, \fBSELF\fP is specified. Use \fBSELF\fP for stack sets with self\-managed permissions.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you are signed in to the management account, specify \fBSELF\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify \fBDELEGATED_ADMIN\fP . Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see \fI\%Register a delegated administrator\fP in the \fIAWS CloudFormation User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
The result status of the stack set operation for the given account in the given Region.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCANCELLED\fP : The operation in the specified account and Region has been cancelled. This is either because a user has stopped the stack set operation, or because the failure tolerance of the stack set operation has been exceeded.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP : The operation in the specified account and Region failed.  If the stack set operation fails in enough accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the stack set operation as a whole might be exceeded.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRUNNING\fP : The operation in the specified account and Region is currently in progress.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPENDING\fP : The operation in the specified account and Region has yet to start.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSUCCEEDED\fP : The account gate function has determined that the account and Region passes any requirements for a stack set operation to occur. AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack operation in that account and Region.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP : The account gate function has determined that the account and Region does not meet the requirements for a stack set operation to occur. AWS CloudFormation cancels the stack set operation in that account and Region, and sets the stack set operation result status for that account and Region to \fBFAILED\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSKIPPED\fP : AWS CloudFormation has skipped calling the account gate function for this account and Region, for one of the following reasons:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
An account gate function has not been specified for the account and Region. AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this account and Region.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBAWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole\fP of the stack set adminstration account lacks permissions to invoke the function. AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this account and Region.
.IP \(bu 2
Either no action is necessary, or no action is possible, on the stack. AWS CloudFormation skips the stack set operation in this account and Region.

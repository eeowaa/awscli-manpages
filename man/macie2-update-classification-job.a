\fB\-\-job\-status\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The new status for the job. Valid values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
CANCELLED \- Stops the job permanently and cancels it. This value is valid only if the job\(aqs current status is IDLE, PAUSED, RUNNING, or USER_PAUSED. If you specify this value and the job\(aqs current status is RUNNING, Amazon Macie immediately begins to stop all processing tasks for the job. You can\(aqt resume or restart a job after you cancel it.
.IP \(bu 2
RUNNING \- Resumes the job. This value is valid only if the job\(aqs current status is USER_PAUSED. If you paused the job while it was actively running and you specify this value less than 30 days after you paused the job, Macie immediately resumes processing from the point where you paused the job. Otherwise, Macie resumes the job according to the schedule and other settings for the job.
.IP \(bu 2
USER_PAUSED \- Pauses the job temporarily. This value is valid only if the job\(aqs current status is IDLE, PAUSED, or RUNNING. If you specify this value and the job\(aqs current status is RUNNING, Macie immediately begins to pause all processing tasks for the job. If you pause a one\-time job and you don\(aqt resume it within 30 days, the job expires and Macie cancels the job. If you pause a recurring job when its status is RUNNING and you don\(aqt resume it within 30 days, the job run expires and Macie cancels the run. To check the expiration date, refer to the UserPausedDetails.jobExpiresAt property.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

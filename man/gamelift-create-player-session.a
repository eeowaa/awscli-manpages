.SH NAME
gamelift-create-player-session \- Reserves an open player slot in a game session for a player
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Reserves an open player slot in a game session for a player. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in \fBACTIVE\fP status and has a player creation policy of \fBACCEPT_ALL\fP . You can add a group of players to a game session with  CreatePlayerSessions .
.sp
To create a player session, specify a game session ID, player ID, and optionally a set of player data.
.sp
If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for the player and a new  PlayerSession object is returned with a player session ID. The player references the player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the GameLift service. Player sessions cannot be updated.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

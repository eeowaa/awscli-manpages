.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves information about the specified managed policy, including the policy\(aqs default version and the total number of IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached. To retrieve the list of the specific users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, use  ListEntitiesForPolicy . This operation returns metadata about the policy. To retrieve the actual policy document for a specific version of the policy, use  GetPolicyVersion .
.sp
This operation retrieves information about managed policies. To retrieve information about an inline policy that is embedded with an IAM user, group, or role, use  GetUserPolicy ,  GetGroupPolicy , or  GetRolePolicy .
.sp
For more information about policies, see \fI\%Managed policies and inline policies\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-policy\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the managed policy that you want information about.
.sp
For more information about ARNs, see \fI\%Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

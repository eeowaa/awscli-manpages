.sp
\fB\-\-application\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the application. This identifier is displayed as the \fBProject ID\fP on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

\fB\-\-journey\-activity\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the journey activity.

\fB\-\-journey\-id\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The string that specifies which page of results to return in a paginated response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign, and journey metrics.

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of items to include in each page of a paginated response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign, and journey metrics.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
JourneyExecutionActivityMetricsResponse \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Provides the results of a query that retrieved the data for a standard execution metric that applies to a journey activity, and provides information about that query.
.sp
ActivityType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of activity that the metric applies to. Possible values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
CONDITIONAL_SPLIT \- For a yes/no split activity, which is an activity that sends participants down one of two paths in a journey.
.IP \(bu 2
HOLDOUT \- For a holdout activity, which is an activity that stops a journey for a specified percentage of participants.
.IP \(bu 2
MESSAGE \- For an email activity, which is an activity that sends an email message to participants.
.IP \(bu 2
MULTI_CONDITIONAL_SPLIT \- For a multivariate split activity, which is an activity that sends participants down one of as many as five paths in a journey.
.IP \(bu 2
RANDOM_SPLIT \- For a random split activity, which is an activity that sends specified percentages of participants down one of as many as five paths in a journey.
.IP \(bu 2
WAIT \- For a wait activity, which is an activity that waits for a certain amount of time or until a specific date and time before moving participants to the next activity in a journey.

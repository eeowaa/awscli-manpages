.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the specified alarms. You can filter the results by specifying a prefix for the alarm name, the alarm state, or a prefix for any action.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBdescribe\-alarms\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBMetricAlarms\fP, \fBCompositeAlarms\fP

.INDENT 3.5
If you use this parameter and specify the name of a composite alarm, the operation returns information about the "children" alarms of the alarm you specify. These are the metric alarms and composite alarms referenced in the \fBAlarmRule\fP field of the composite alarm that you specify in \fBChildrenOfAlarmName\fP . Information about the composite alarm that you name in \fBChildrenOfAlarmName\fP is not returned.
.sp
If you specify \fBChildrenOfAlarmName\fP , you cannot specify any other parameters in the request except for \fBMaxRecords\fP and \fBNextToken\fP . If you do so, you receive a validation error.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
Metrics \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of MetricDataQuery structures, used in an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each structure either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression. One item in the Metrics array is the math expression that the alarm watches. This expression by designated by having \fBReturnData\fP set to true.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This structure is used in both \fBGetMetricData\fP and \fBPutMetricAlarm\fP . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.
.sp
When used in \fBGetMetricData\fP , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single \fBGetMetricData\fP call can include up to 500 \fBMetricDataQuery\fP structures.
.sp
When used in \fBPutMetricAlarm\fP , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each \fBMetricDataQuery\fP in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single \fBPutMetricAlarm\fP call can include up to 20 \fBMetricDataQuery\fP structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a \fBMetricStat\fP parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the \fBExpression\fP parameter to perform a math expression. Of those \fBExpression\fP structures, one must have \fBTrue\fP as the value for \fBReturnData\fP . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.
.sp
Any expression used in a \fBPutMetricAlarm\fP operation must return a single time series. For more information, see \fI\%Metric Math Syntax and Functions\fP in the \fIAmazon CloudWatch User Guide\fP .
.sp
Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a \fBGetMetricData\fP operation or a \fBPutMetricAlarm\fP operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.
.sp
Id \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to \fBGetMetricData\fP . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MetricStat \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.
.sp
Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either \fBExpression\fP or \fBMetricStat\fP but not both.
.sp
Metric \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

Period \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high\-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High\-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a \fBPutMetricData\fP call that includes a \fBStorageResolution\fP of 1 second.
.sp
If the \fBStartTime\fP parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

Unit \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you are using a \fBPut\fP operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.
.sp
In a \fBGet\fP operation, if you omit \fBUnit\fP then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

Expression \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the \fBId\fP of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the \fBId\fP of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see \fI\%Metric Math Syntax and Functions\fP in the \fIAmazon CloudWatch User Guide\fP .
.sp
Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either \fBExpression\fP or \fBMetricStat\fP but not both.

Label \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A human\-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.
.sp
You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see \fI\%Using Dynamic Labels\fP .

ReturnData \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When used in \fBGetMetricData\fP , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify \fBFalse\fP . If you omit this, the default of \fBTrue\fP is used.
.sp
When used in \fBPutMetricAlarm\fP , specify \fBTrue\fP for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same \fBPutMetricAlarm\fP operation, specify \fBReturnData\fP as False.

.sp
Period \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high\-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High\-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a \fBPutMetricData\fP operation that includes a \fBStorageResolution of 1 second\fP .

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists all IAM users, groups, and roles that the specified managed policy is attached to.
.sp
You can use the optional \fBEntityFilter\fP parameter to limit the results to a particular type of entity (users, groups, or roles). For example, to list only the roles that are attached to the specified policy, set \fBEntityFilter\fP to \fBRole\fP .
.sp
You can paginate the results using the \fBMaxItems\fP and \fBMarker\fP parameters.
.sp
See also: AWS API Documentation
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBlist\-entities\-for\-policy\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBPolicyGroups\fP, \fBPolicyUsers\fP, \fBPolicyRoles\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-policy\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy for which you want the versions.
.sp
For more information about ARNs, see \fI\%Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-entity\-filter\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The entity type to use for filtering the results.
.sp
For example, when \fBEntityFilter\fP is \fBRole\fP , only the roles that are attached to the specified policy are returned. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all attached entities (users, groups, and roles) are returned. The argument for this parameter must be one of the valid values listed below.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUser\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRole\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBGroup\fP
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fBAWSManagedPolicy\fP
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-path\-prefix\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all entities.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\fB\eu0021\fP ) through the DEL character (\fB\eu007F\fP ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-policy\-usage\-filter\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.
.sp
To list only permissions policies, set \fBPolicyUsageFilter\fP to \fBPermissionsPolicy\fP . To list only the policies used to set permissions boundaries, set the value to \fBPermissionsBoundary\fP .
.sp
This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are returned.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPermissionsPolicy\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPermissionsBoundary\fP
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

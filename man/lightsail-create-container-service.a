.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an Amazon Lightsail container service.
.sp
A Lightsail container service is a compute resource to which you can deploy containers. For more information, see \fI\%Container services in Amazon Lightsail\fP in the \fILightsail Dev Guide\fP .
.sp
See also: AWS API Documentation
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-service\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name for the container service.
.sp
The name that you specify for your container service will make up part of its default domain. The default domain of a container service is typically \fBhttps://<ServiceName>.<RandomGUID>.<AWSRegion>.cs.amazonlightsail.com\fP . If the name of your container service is \fBcontainer\-service\-1\fP , and it\(aqs located in the US East (Ohio) AWS region (\fBus\-east\-2\fP ), then the domain for your container service will be like the following example: \fBhttps://container\-service\-1.ur4EXAMPLE2uq.us\-east\-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com\fP
.sp
The following are the requirements for container service names:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Must be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account.
.IP \(bu 2
Must contain 1 to 63 characters.
.IP \(bu 2
Must contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
.IP \(bu 2
A hyphen (\-) can separate words but cannot be at the start or end of the name.

.sp
\fB\-\-power\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The power specification for the container service.
.sp
The power specifies the amount of memory, vCPUs, and base monthly cost of each node of the container service. The \fBpower\fP and \fBscale\fP of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the \fBpower\fP with the \fBscale\fP (the number of nodes) of the service.
.sp
Use the \fBGetContainerServicePowers\fP action to get a list of power options that you can specify using this parameter, and their base monthly cost.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnano\fP

.INDENT 3.5
The scale specification for the container service.
.sp
The scale specifies the allocated compute nodes of the container service. The \fBpower\fP and \fBscale\fP of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the \fBpower\fP with the \fBscale\fP (the number of nodes) of the service.

.INDENT 3.5
The public domain names to use with the container service, such as \fBexample.com\fP and \fBwww.example.com\fP .
.sp
You can specify up to four public domain names for a container service. The domain names that you specify are used when you create a deployment with a container configured as the public endpoint of your container service.
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify public domain names, then you can use the default domain of the container service.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You must create and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before you can use public domain names with your container service. Use the \fBCreateCertificate\fP action to create a certificate for the public domain names you want to use with your container service.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

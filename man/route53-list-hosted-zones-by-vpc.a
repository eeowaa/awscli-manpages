.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists all the private hosted zones that a specified VPC is associated with, regardless of which AWS account or AWS service owns the hosted zones. The \fBHostedZoneOwner\fP structure in the response contains one of the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An \fBOwningAccount\fP element, which contains the account number of either the current AWS account or another AWS account. Some services, such as AWS Cloud Map, create hosted zones using the current account.
.IP \(bu 2
An \fBOwningService\fP element, which identifies the AWS service that created and owns the hosted zone. For example, if a hosted zone was created by Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), the value of \fBOwner\fP is \fBefs.amazonaws.com\fP .

\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) The maximum number of hosted zones that you want Amazon Route 53 to return. If the specified VPC is associated with more than \fBMaxItems\fP hosted zones, the response includes a \fBNextToken\fP element. \fBNextToken\fP contains an encrypted token that identifies the first hosted zone that Route 53 will return if you submit another request.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the previous response included a \fBNextToken\fP element, the specified VPC is associated with more hosted zones. To get more hosted zones, submit another \fBListHostedZonesByVPC\fP request.
.sp
For the value of \fBNextToken\fP , specify the value of \fBNextToken\fP from the previous response.
.sp
If the previous response didn\(aqt include a \fBNextToken\fP element, there are no more hosted zones to get.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
HostedZoneSummaries \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list that contains one \fBHostedZoneSummary\fP element for each hosted zone that the specified Amazon VPC is associated with. Each \fBHostedZoneSummary\fP element contains the hosted zone name and ID, and information about who owns the hosted zone.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In the response to a \fBListHostedZonesByVPC\fP request, the \fBHostedZoneSummaries\fP element contains one \fBHostedZoneSummary\fP element for each hosted zone that the specified Amazon VPC is associated with. Each \fBHostedZoneSummary\fP element contains the hosted zone name and ID, and information about who owns the hosted zone.
.sp
HostedZoneId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Route 53 hosted zone ID of a private hosted zone that the specified VPC is associated with.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the private hosted zone, such as \fBexample.com\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Owner \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The owner of a private hosted zone that the specified VPC is associated with. The owner can be either an AWS account or an AWS service.
.sp
OwningAccount \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the hosted zone was created by an AWS account, or was created by an AWS service that creates hosted zones using the current account, \fBOwningAccount\fP contains the account ID of that account. For example, when you use AWS Cloud Map to create a hosted zone, Cloud Map creates the hosted zone using the current AWS account.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
OwningService \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If an AWS service uses its own account to create a hosted zone and associate the specified VPC with that hosted zone, \fBOwningService\fP contains an abbreviation that identifies the service. For example, if Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) created a hosted zone and associated a VPC with the hosted zone, the value of \fBOwningService\fP is \fBefs.amazonaws.com\fP .

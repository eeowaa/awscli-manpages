.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates Realtime script metadata and content.
.sp
To update script metadata, specify the script ID and provide updated name and/or version values.
.sp
To update script content, provide an updated zip file by pointing to either a local file or an Amazon S3 bucket location. You can use either method regardless of how the original script was uploaded. Use the \fIVersion\fP parameter to track updates to the script.
.sp
If the call is successful, the updated metadata is stored in the script record and a revised script is uploaded to the Amazon GameLift service. Once the script is updated and acquired by a fleet instance, the new version is used for all new game sessions.

.sp
\fB\-\-storage\-location\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the \fBObjectVersion\fP parameter to specify an earlier version.
.sp
Bucket \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. This is the name of the S3 bucket.

.sp
ObjectVersion \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The version of the file, if object versioning is turned on for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter to specify a specific version of the file. If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.

\fB\-\-zip\-file\fP (blob)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB.
.sp
When using the AWS CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example: \fB\-\-zip\-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

dynamodbstreams-describe-stream \- Returns information about a stream, including the current status of the stream, its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the composition of its shards, and its corresponding DynamoDB table
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns information about a stream, including the current status of the stream, its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the composition of its shards, and its corresponding DynamoDB table.

.sp
Each shard in the stream has a \fBSequenceNumberRange\fP associated with it. If the \fBSequenceNumberRange\fP has a \fBStartingSequenceNumber\fP but no \fBEndingSequenceNumber\fP , then the shard is still open (able to receive more stream records). If both \fBStartingSequenceNumber\fP and \fBEndingSequenceNumber\fP are present, then that shard is closed and can no longer receive more data.

.sp
\fB\-\-limit\fP (integer)

.sp
\fB\-\-exclusive\-start\-shard\-id\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
StreamDescription \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A complete description of the stream, including its creation date and time, the DynamoDB table associated with the stream, the shard IDs within the stream, and the beginning and ending sequence numbers of stream records within the shards.

StreamLabel \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream.
.sp
Note that \fBLatestStreamLabel\fP is not a unique identifier for the stream, because it is possible that a stream from another table might have the same timestamp. However, the combination of the following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
the AWS customer ID.
.IP \(bu 2
the table name
.IP \(bu 2
the \fBStreamLabel\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates the current status of the stream:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBENABLING\fP \- Streams is currently being enabled on the DynamoDB table.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBENABLED\fP \- the stream is enabled.

.UNINDENT

.sp
KeySchema \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key attribute(s) of the stream\(aqs DynamoDB table.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents \fIa single element\fP of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.
.sp
A \fBKeySchemaElement\fP represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one \fBKeySchemaElement\fP (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one \fBKeySchemaElement\fP for the partition key, and another \fBKeySchemaElement\fP for the sort key.
.sp
A \fBKeySchemaElement\fP must be a scalar, top\-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.
.sp
AttributeName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of a key attribute.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
KeyType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The role that this key attribute will assume:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBHASH\fP \- partition key
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRANGE\fP \- sort key
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
The partition key of an item is also known as its \fIhash attribute\fP . The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB\(aqs usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.
.sp
The sort key of an item is also known as its \fIrange attribute\fP . The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

LastEvaluatedShardId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The shard ID of the item where the operation stopped, inclusive of the previous result set. Use this value to start a new operation, excluding this value in the new request.
.sp
If \fBLastEvaluatedShardId\fP is empty, then the "last page" of results has been processed and there is currently no more data to be retrieved.
.sp
If \fBLastEvaluatedShardId\fP is not empty, it does not necessarily mean that there is more data in the result set. The only way to know when you have reached the end of the result set is when \fBLastEvaluatedShardId\fP is empty.

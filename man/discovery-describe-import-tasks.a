\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of results that you want this request to return, up to 100.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0

The token to request a specific page of results.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

errorsAndFailedEntriesZip \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A link to a compressed archive folder (in the ZIP format) that contains an error log and a file of failed records. You can use these two files to quickly identify records that failed, why they failed, and correct those records. Afterward, you can upload the corrected file to your Amazon S3 bucket and create another import task request.
.sp
This field also includes authorization information so you can confirm the authenticity of the compressed archive before you download it.
.sp
If some records failed to be imported we recommend that you correct the records in the failed entries file and then imports that failed entries file. This prevents you from having to correct and update the larger original file and attempt importing it again.

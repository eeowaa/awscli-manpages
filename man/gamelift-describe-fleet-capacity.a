.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the resource capacity settings for one or more fleets. The data returned includes the current fleet capacity (number of EC2 instances), and settings that can control how capacity scaling. For fleets with remote locations, this operation retrieves data for the fleet\(aqs home Region only. See  DescribeFleetLocationCapacity to get capacity settings for a fleet\(aqs remote locations.
.sp
This operation can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To get capacity data for one or more specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.
.IP \(bu 2
To get capacity data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
.sp
If successful, a  FleetCapacity object is returned for each requested fleet ID. Each FleetCapacity object includes a \fBLocation\fP property, which is set to the fleet\(aqs home Region. When a list of fleet IDs is provided, attribute objects are returned only for fleets that currently exist.

Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs that are allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

\fBdescribe\-fleet\-capacity\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBFleetCapacity\fP

\fB\-\-fleet\-ids\fP (list)

A unique identifier for the fleet(s) to retrieve capacity information for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Leave this parameter empty to retrieve capacity information for all fleets.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

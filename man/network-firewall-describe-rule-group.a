\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
UpdateToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the rule group. The token marks the state of the rule group resource at the time of the request.
.sp
To make changes to the rule group, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group hasn\(aqt changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an \fBInvalidTokenException\fP . If this happens, retrieve the rule group again to get a current copy of it with a current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.

.INDENT 3.5
The object that defines the rules in a rule group. This, along with  RuleGroupResponse , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup .
.sp
AWS Network Firewall uses a rule group to inspect and control network traffic. You define stateless rule groups to inspect individual packets and you define stateful rule groups to inspect packets in the context of their traffic flow.
.sp
To use a rule group, you include it by reference in an Network Firewall firewall policy, then you use the policy in a firewall. You can reference a rule group from more than one firewall policy, and you can use a firewall policy in more than one firewall.

.sp
To provide more than one action in this setting, separate the settings with a comma.

Each stateless rule group uses exactly one \fBStatelessRulesAndCustomActions\fP object, and each \fBStatelessRulesAndCustomActions\fP contains exactly one \fBStatelessRules\fP object. To ensure unique priority settings for your rule groups, set unique priorities for the stateless rules that you define inside any single \fBStatelessRules\fP object.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
In a rule group\(aqs  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The custom actions are available for use by name inside the \fBStatelessRulesAndCustomActions\fP where you define them.

.IP \(bu 2
In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in \fBStatelessCustomActions\fP . The custom actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them.

.sp
You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it.

AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to \fBCustomAction\fP and you provide the dimension value.

.SH NAME
logs-associate-kms-key \- Associates the specified AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) with the specified log group
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Associates the specified AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) with the specified log group.
.sp
Associating an AWS KMS CMK with a log group overrides any existing associations between the log group and a CMK. After a CMK is associated with a log group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the CMK. This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the CMK is still within Amazon CloudWatch Logs. This enables Amazon CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric CMKs. Do not use an associate an asymmetric CMK with your log group. For more information, see \fI\%Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys\fP .

.sp
It can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect.
.sp
If you attempt to associate a CMK with a log group but the CMK does not exist or the CMK is disabled, you receive an \fBInvalidParameterException\fP error.

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK to use when encrypting log data. This must be a symmetric CMK. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon Resource Names \- AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)\fP and \fI\%Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

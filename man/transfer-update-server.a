\fB\-\-certificate\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate. Required when \fBProtocols\fP is set to \fBFTPS\fP .
.sp
To request a new public certificate, see \fI\%Request a public certificate\fP in the \fIAWS Certificate Manager User Guide\fP .
.sp
To import an existing certificate into ACM, see \fI\%Importing certificates into ACM\fP in the \fIAWS Certificate Manager User Guide\fP .

You can edit the \fBSecurityGroupIds\fP property in the \fI\%UpdateServer\fP API only if you are changing the \fBEndpointType\fP from \fBPUBLIC\fP or \fBVPC_ENDPOINT\fP to \fBVPC\fP . To change security groups associated with your server\(aqs VPC endpoint after creation, use the Amazon EC2 \fI\%ModifyVpcEndpoint\fP API.

\fB\-\-endpoint\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose to make your server\(aqs endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it.

After March 31, 2021, you won\(aqt be able to create a server using \fBEndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT\fP in your AWS account if your account hasn\(aqt already done so before March 31, 2021. If you have already created servers with \fBEndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT\fP in your AWS account on or before March 31, 2021, you will not be affected. After this date, use \fBEndpointType\fP =\(ga\(gaVPC\(ga\(ga .
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create\-server\-in\-vpc.html#deprecate\-vpc\-endpoint\fP\&.
.sp
It is recommended that you use \fBVPC\fP as the \fBEndpointType\fP . With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server\(aqs endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client\(aqs public IP address. This is not possible with \fBEndpointType\fP set to \fBVPC_ENDPOINT\fP .

\fB\-\-protocols\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server\(aqs endpoint. The available protocols are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP): File transfer over SSH

.INDENT 3.5
If you select \fBFTPS\fP , you must choose a certificate stored in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) which will be used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.
.sp
If \fBProtocol\fP includes either \fBFTP\fP or \fBFTPS\fP , then the \fBEndpointType\fP must be \fBVPC\fP and the \fBIdentityProviderType\fP must be \fBAWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE\fP or \fBAPI_GATEWAY\fP .
.sp
If \fBProtocol\fP includes \fBFTP\fP , then \fBAddressAllocationIds\fP cannot be associated.
.sp
If \fBProtocol\fP is set only to \fBSFTP\fP , the \fBEndpointType\fP can be set to \fBPUBLIC\fP and the \fBIdentityProviderType\fP can be set to \fBSERVICE_MANAGED\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

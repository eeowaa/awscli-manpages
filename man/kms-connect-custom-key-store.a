.SH NAME
kms-connect-custom-key-store \- Connects or reconnects a %custom key store to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Connects or reconnects a \fI\%custom key store\fP to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.
.sp
The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time.
.sp
To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the \fI\%DescribeClusters\fP operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the \fI\%CreateHsm\fP operation. Also, the \(ga \fBkmsuser\fP crypto user <\fI\%https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key\-store\-concepts.html#concept\-kmsuser\fP>\(ga__ (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from using this account to log in.
.sp
The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
.sp
During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the \fBkmsuser\fP CU, and rotates its password.
.sp
The \fBConnectCustomKeyStore\fP operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the \fBConnectionErrorCode\fP in the response. For help interpreting the \fBConnectionErrorCode\fP , see  CustomKeyStoresListEntry .
.sp
To fix the failure, use the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the  UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use \fBConnectCustomKeyStore\fP again.
.sp
If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see \fI\%Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store\fP in the \fIAWS Key Management Service Developer Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-custom\-key\-store\-id\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
Enter the key store ID of the custom key store that you want to connect. To find the ID of a custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBTo connect a custom key store\fP
.sp
The following \fBconnect\-custom\-key\-store\fP example reconnects the specified custom key store. You can use a command like this one to connect a custom key store for the first time or to reconnect a key store that was disconnected.

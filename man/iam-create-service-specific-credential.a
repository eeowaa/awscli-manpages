.sp
You can have a maximum of two sets of service\-specific credentials for each supported service per user.
.sp
You can create service\-specific credentials for AWS CodeCommit and Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra).
.sp
You can reset the password to a new service\-generated value by calling  ResetServiceSpecificCredential .
.sp
For more information about service\-specific credentials, see \fI\%Using IAM with AWS CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and AWS access keys\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-user\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the IAM user that is to be associated with the credentials. The new service\-specific credentials have the same permissions as the associated user except that they can be used only to access the specified service.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-

\fB\-\-service\-name\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

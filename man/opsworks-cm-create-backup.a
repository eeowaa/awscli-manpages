.SH NAME
opsworks-cm-create-backup \- Creates an application-level backup of a server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an application\-level backup of a server. While the server is in the \fBBACKING_UP\fP state, the server cannot be changed, and no additional backup can be created.
.sp
Backups can be created for servers in \fBRUNNING\fP , \fBHEALTHY\fP , and \fBUNHEALTHY\fP states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups.
.sp
This operation is asynchronous.
.sp
A \fBLimitExceededException\fP is thrown when the maximum number of manual backups is reached. An \fBInvalidStateException\fP is thrown when the server is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A \fBResourceNotFoundException\fP is thrown when the server is not found. A \fBValidationException\fP is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

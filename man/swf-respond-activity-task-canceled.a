.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Used by workers to tell the service that the  ActivityTask identified by the \fBtaskToken\fP was successfully canceled. Additional \fBdetails\fP can be provided using the \fBdetails\fP argument.
.sp
These \fBdetails\fP (if provided) appear in the \fBActivityTaskCanceled\fP event added to the workflow history.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Only use this operation if the \fBcanceled\fP flag of a  RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat request returns \fBtrue\fP and if the activity can be safely undone or abandoned.

A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it is closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is processing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a call to  RespondActivityTaskCompleted , RespondActivityTaskCanceled,  RespondActivityTaskFailed , or the task has \fI\%timed out\fP .

You can use IAM policies to control this action\(aqs access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use a \fBResource\fP element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
.IP \(bu 2
Use an \fBAction\fP element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action\(aqs parameters.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the caller doesn\(aqt have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute\(aqs \fBcause\fP parameter is set to \fBOPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED\fP . For details and example IAM policies, see \fI\%Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows\fP in the \fIAmazon SWF Developer Guide\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
\fBtaskToken\fP is generated by the service and should be treated as an opaque value. If the task is passed to another process, its \fBtaskToken\fP must also be passed. This enables it to provide its progress and respond with results.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

cognito-identity-lookup-developer-identity \- Retrieves the IdentityID associated with a DeveloperUserIdentifier or the list of DeveloperUserIdentifier values associated with an IdentityId for an existing identity
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the \fBIdentityID\fP associated with a \fBDeveloperUserIdentifier\fP or the list of \fBDeveloperUserIdentifier\fP values associated with an \fBIdentityId\fP for an existing identity. Either \fBIdentityID\fP or \fBDeveloperUserIdentifier\fP must not be null. If you supply only one of these values, the other value will be searched in the database and returned as a part of the response. If you supply both, \fBDeveloperUserIdentifier\fP will be matched against \fBIdentityID\fP . If the values are verified against the database, the response returns both values and is the same as the request. Otherwise a \fBResourceConflictException\fP is thrown.

\fBLookupDeveloperIdentity\fP is intended for low\-throughput control plane operations: for example, to enable customer service to locate an identity ID by username. If you are using it for higher\-volume operations such as user authentication, your requests are likely to be throttled.  GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity is a better option for higher\-volume operations for user authentication.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-identity\-pool\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-identity\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier in the format REGION:GUID.

.sp
\fB\-\-developer\-user\-identifier\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique ID used by your backend authentication process to identify a user. Typically, a developer identity provider would issue many developer user identifiers, in keeping with the number of users.

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of identities to return.

\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A pagination token. The first call you make will have \fBNextToken\fP set to null. After that the service will return \fBNextToken\fP values as needed. For example, let\(aqs say you make a request with \fBMaxResults\fP set to 10, and there are 20 matches in the database. The service will return a pagination token as a part of the response. This token can be used to call the API again and get results starting from the 11th match.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

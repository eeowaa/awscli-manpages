.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that detects text in a document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a line of text.
.sp
You start asynchronous text detection by calling  StartDocumentTextDetection , which returns a job identifier (\fBJobId\fP ). When the text detection operation finishes, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that\(aqs registered in the initial call to \fBStartDocumentTextDetection\fP . To get the results of the text\-detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is \fBSUCCEEDED\fP . If so, call \fBGetDocumentTextDetection\fP , and pass the job identifier (\fBJobId\fP ) from the initial call to \fBStartDocumentTextDetection\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBGetDocumentTextDetection\fP returns an array of  Block objects.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each document page has as an associated \fBBlock\fP of type PAGE. Each PAGE \fBBlock\fP object is the parent of LINE \fBBlock\fP objects that represent the lines of detected text on a page. A LINE \fBBlock\fP object is a parent for each word that makes up the line. Words are represented by \fBBlock\fP objects of type WORD.
.sp
Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of blocks that are returned. If there are more results than specified in \fBMaxResults\fP , the value of \fBNextToken\fP in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call \fBGetDocumentTextDetection\fP , and populate the \fBNextToken\fP request parameter with the token value that\(aqs returned from the previous call to \fBGetDocumentTextDetection\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-job\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the text detection job. The \fBJobId\fP is returned from \fBStartDocumentTextDetection\fP . A \fBJobId\fP value is only valid for 7 days.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest value you can specify is 1,000. If you specify a value greater than 1,000, a maximum of 1,000 results is returned. The default value is 1,000.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more blocks to retrieve), Amazon Textract returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set of blocks.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

A \fBBlock\fP represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a \fBBlock\fP object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText ), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.
.sp
An array of \fBBlock\fP objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of \fBBlock\fP objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

.SH NAME
acm-pca-delete-certificate-authority \- Deletes a private certificate authority (CA)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that you want to delete. You can find the ARN by calling the \fI\%ListCertificateAuthorities\fP action.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in your CA hierarchy.

.sp
Before you can delete a CA that you have created and activated, you must disable it. To do this, call the \fI\%UpdateCertificateAuthority\fP action and set the \fBCertificateAuthorityStatus\fP parameter to \fBDISABLED\fP .
.sp
Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (that is, the status of the CA is \fBCREATING\fP ). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven\(aqt yet imported the signed certificate into ACM Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is \fBPENDING_CERTIFICATE\fP ).
.sp
When you successfully call \fI\%DeleteCertificateAuthority\fP , the CA\(aqs status changes to \fBDELETED\fP . However, the CA won\(aqt be permanently deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the \fBPermanentDeletionTimeInDays\fP parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The \fI\%DescribeCertificateAuthority\fP action returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a private CA in the \fBDELETED\fP state. To restore an eligible CA, call the \fI\%RestoreCertificateAuthority\fP action.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

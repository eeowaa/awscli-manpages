.SH NAME
datasync-create-agent \- Activates an AWS DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Activates an AWS DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information such as the AWS Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the AWS Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this AWS Region.
.sp
You can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public internet.
.sp
You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run.
.sp
Agents are automatically updated by AWS on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-activation\-key\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Your agent activation key. You can get the activation key either by sending an HTTP GET request with redirects that enable you to get the agent IP address (port 80). Alternatively, you can get it from the AWS DataSync console.
.sp
The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for your agent in the query string parameter \fBactivationKey\fP . It might also include other activation\-related parameters; however, these are merely defaults. The arguments you pass to this API call determine the actual configuration of your agent.
.sp
For more information, see Activating an Agent in the \fIAWS DataSync User Guide.\fP

\fB\-\-agent\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name you configured for your agent. This value is a text reference that is used to identify the agent in the console.

.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key\-value pair that represents the tag that you want to associate with the agent. The value can be an empty string. This value helps you manage, filter, and search for your agents.
.sp

Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF\-8 format, and the following special characters: + \- = . _ : / @.

.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents a single entry in a list of AWS resource tags. \fBTagListEntry\fP returns an array that contains a list of tasks when the \fI\%ListTagsForResource\fP operation is called.
.sp
Key \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The key for an AWS resource tag.

\fB\-\-vpc\-endpoint\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the VPC (virtual private cloud) endpoint that the agent has access to. This is the client\-side VPC endpoint, also called a PrivateLink. If you don\(aqt have a PrivateLink VPC endpoint, see \fI\%Creating a VPC Endpoint Service Configuration\fP in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
.sp
VPC endpoint ID looks like this: \fBvpce\-01234d5aff67890e1\fP .

\fB\-\-subnet\-arns\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets in which DataSync will create elastic network interfaces for each data transfer task. The agent that runs a task must be private. When you start a task that is associated with an agent created in a VPC, or one that has access to an IP address in a VPC, then the task is also private. In this case, DataSync creates four network interfaces for each task in your subnet. For a data transfer to work, the agent must be able to route to all these four network interfaces.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

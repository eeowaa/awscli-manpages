.SH NAME
organizations-create-organization \- Creates an AWS organization
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an AWS organization. The account whose user is calling the \fBCreateOrganization\fP operation automatically becomes the \fI\%management account\fP of the new organization.
.sp
This operation must be called using credentials from the account that is to become the new organization\(aqs management account. The principal must also have the relevant IAM permissions.
.sp
By default (or if you set the \fBFeatureSet\fP parameter to \fBALL\fP ), the new organization is created with all features enabled and service control policies automatically enabled in the root. If you instead choose to create the organization supporting only the consolidated billing features by setting the \fBFeatureSet\fP parameter to \fBCONSOLIDATED_BILLING"\fP , no policy types are enabled by default, and you can\(aqt use organization policies

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBExample 1: To create a new organization\fP
.sp
Bill wants to create an organization using credentials from account 111111111111. The following example shows that the account becomes the master account in the new organization. Because he does not specify a features set, the new organization defaults to all features enabled and service control policies are enabled on the root.

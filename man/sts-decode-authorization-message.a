.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Decodes additional information about the authorization status of a request from an encoded message returned in response to an AWS request.
.sp
For example, if a user is not authorized to perform an operation that he or she has requested, the request returns a \fBClient.UnauthorizedOperation\fP response (an HTTP 403 response). Some AWS operations additionally return an encoded message that can provide details about this authorization failure.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Only certain AWS operations return an encoded authorization message. The documentation for an individual operation indicates whether that operation returns an encoded message in addition to returning an HTTP code.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The message is encoded because the details of the authorization status can constitute privileged information that the user who requested the operation should not see. To decode an authorization status message, a user must be granted permissions via an IAM policy to request the \fBDecodeAuthorizationMessage\fP (\fBsts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage\fP ) action.
.sp
The decoded message includes the following type of information:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Whether the request was denied due to an explicit deny or due to the absence of an explicit allow. For more information, see \fI\%Determining Whether a Request is Allowed or Denied\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
The principal who made the request.
.IP \(bu 2
The requested action.
.IP \(bu 2
The requested resource.
.IP \(bu 2
The values of condition keys in the context of the user\(aqs request.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

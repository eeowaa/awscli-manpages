.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Create a new pool of dedicated IP addresses. A pool can include one or more dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your AWS account. You can associate a pool with a configuration set. When you send an email that uses that configuration set, the message is sent from one of the addresses in the associated pool.

\fB\-\-pool\-name\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The name of the dedicated IP pool.

\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An object that defines the tags (keys and values) that you want to associate with the pool.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A \fItag\fP is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.
.sp
Each tag consists of a required \fItag key\fP and an associated \fItag value\fP , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + \-. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
.IP \(bu 2
For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBaws:\fP prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can\(aqt edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource.
.IP \(bu 2
You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account.

Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
One part of a key\-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The optional part of a key\-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don\(aqt want a resource to have a specific tag value, don\(aqt specify a value for this parameter. If you don\(aqt specify a value, Amazon SES sets the value to an empty string.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
s3api-get-bucket-accelerate-configuration \- This implementation of the GET action uses the accelerate subresource to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is either Enabled or Suspended 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This implementation of the GET action uses the \fBaccelerate\fP subresource to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is either \fBEnabled\fP or \fBSuspended\fP . Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket\-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to and from Amazon S3.
.sp
To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the \fBs3:GetAccelerateConfiguration\fP action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see \fI\%Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations\fP and \fI\%Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
You set the Transfer Acceleration state of an existing bucket to \fBEnabled\fP or \fBSuspended\fP by using the \fI\%PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration\fP operation.
.sp
A GET \fBaccelerate\fP request does not return a state value for a bucket that has no transfer acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Acceleration state if a state has never been set on the bucket.
.sp
For more information about transfer acceleration, see \fI\%Transfer Acceleration\fP in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

.sp
\fB\-\-bucket\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the bucket for which the accelerate configuration is retrieved.

.sp
\fB\-\-expected\-bucket\-owner\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP \fB403 (Access Denied)\fP error.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

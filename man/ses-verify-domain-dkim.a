.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you execute the \fBVerifyDomainDkim\fP operation, the domain that you specify is added to the list of identities that are associated with your account. This is true even if you haven\(aqt already associated the domain with your account by using the \fBVerifyDomainIdentity\fP operation. However, you can\(aqt send email from the domain until you either successfully \fI\%verify it\fP or you successfully \fI\%set up DKIM for it\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME records. When Amazon SES detects that you\(aqve added these records to the DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that domain. You can start sending email even if you haven\(aqt added the TXT record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is authenticated using DKIM.
.sp
To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBName\fP : \fItoken\fP ._domainkey.*example.com*
.IP \(bu 2
\fBType\fP : CNAME
.IP \(bu 2
\fBValue\fP : \fItoken\fP .dkim.amazonses.com
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the preceding example, replace \fItoken\fP with one of the tokens that are generated when you execute this operation. Replace \fIexample.com\fP with your domain. Repeat this process for each token that\(aqs generated by this operation.
.sp
You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-domain\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the domain to be verified for Easy DKIM signing.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo generate a verified domain\(aqs DKIM tokens for DKIM signing with Amazon SES\fP
.sp
The following example uses the \fBverify\-domain\-dkim\fP command to generate DKIM tokens for a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws ses verify\-domain\-dkim \-\-domain example.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
   "DkimTokens": [
       "EXAMPLEq76owjnks3lnluwg65scbemvw",
       "EXAMPLEi3dnsj67hstzaj673klariwx2",
       "EXAMPLEwfbtcukvimehexktmdtaz6naj"
   ]
}
.ft P

.sp
To set up DKIM, you must use the returned DKIM tokens to update your domain\(aqs DNS settings with CNAME records that point to DKIM public keys hosted by Amazon SES. For more information, see \fI\%Easy DKIM in Amazon SES\fP in the \fIAmazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide\fP\&.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
DkimTokens \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A set of character strings that represent the domain\(aqs identity. If the identity is an email address, the tokens represent the domain of that address.
.sp
Using these tokens, you need to create DNS CNAME records that point to DKIM public keys that are hosted by Amazon SES. Amazon Web Services eventually detects that you\(aqve updated your DNS records. This detection process might take up to 72 hours. After successful detection, Amazon SES is able to DKIM\-sign email originating from that domain. (This only applies to domain identities, not email address identities.)
.sp
For more information about creating DNS records using DKIM tokens, see the \fI\%Amazon SES Developer Guide\fP .

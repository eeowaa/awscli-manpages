.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists all of the organizational units (OUs) or accounts that are contained in the specified parent OU or root. This operation, along with  ListParents enables you to traverse the tree structure that makes up this root.

Always check the \fBNextToken\fP response parameter for a \fBnull\fP value when calling a \fBList*\fP operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The \fBNextToken\fP response parameter value is \fBnull\fP  \fIonly\fP when there are no more results to display.

This operation can be called only from the organization\(aqs management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.

\fBlist\-children\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBChildren\fP

\fB\-\-parent\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier (ID) for the parent root or OU whose children you want to list.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP for a parent ID string requires one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRoot\fP \- A string that begins with "r\-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOrganizational unit (OU)\fP \- A string that begins with "ou\-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "\-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Contains a list of child entities, either OUs or accounts.
.sp
Id \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier (ID) of this child entity.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP for a child ID string requires one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAccount\fP \- A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOrganizational unit (OU)\fP \- A string that begins with "ou\-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by a second "\-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the \fBNextToken\fP request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the \fBNextToken\fP response element comes back as \fBnull\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-resource\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL for which you want to get the  LoggingConfiguration .
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.sp
RedactedFields \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You must use one of the following values: \fBURI\fP , \fBQUERY_STRING\fP , \fBHEADER\fP , or \fBMETHOD\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect. Include the single \fBFieldToMatch\fP type that you want to inspect, with additional specifications as needed, according to the type. You specify a single request component in \fBFieldToMatch\fP for each rule statement that requires it. To inspect more than one component of a web request, create a separate rule statement for each component.
.sp
SingleHeader \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, \fBUser\-Agent\fP or \fBReferer\fP . This setting isn\(aqt case sensitive.
.sp
Example JSON: \fB"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }\fP
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the query header to inspect.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SingleQueryArgument \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as \fIUserName\fP or \fISalesRegion\fP . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isn\(aqt case sensitive.
.sp
This is used only to indicate the web request component for AWS WAF to inspect, in the  FieldToMatch specification.
.sp
Example JSON: \fB"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }\fP
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the query argument to inspect.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AllQueryArguments \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Inspect all query arguments.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
UriPath \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
QueryString \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a \fB?\fP character, if any.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Body \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
.sp
Note that only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. If you don\(aqt need to inspect more than 8 KB, you can guarantee that you don\(aqt allow additional bytes in by combining a statement that inspects the body of the web request, such as  ByteMatchStatement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of the request. AWS WAF doesn\(aqt support inspecting the entire contents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Method \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
JsonBody \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
.sp
Note that only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. If you don\(aqt need to inspect more than 8 KB, you can guarantee that you don\(aqt allow additional bytes in by combining a statement that inspects the body of the web request, such as  ByteMatchStatement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of the request. AWS WAF doesn\(aqt support inspecting the entire contents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.
.sp
MatchPattern \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The patterns to look for in the JSON body. AWS WAF inspects the results of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.
.sp
All \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Match all of the elements. See also \fBMatchScope\fP in  JsonBody .
.sp
You must specify either this setting or the \fBIncludedPaths\fP setting, but not both.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
IncludedPaths \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Match only the specified include paths. See also \fBMatchScope\fP in  JsonBody .
.sp
Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, \fB"IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]\fP . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation \fI\%JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer\fP .
.sp
You must specify either this setting or the \fBAll\fP setting, but not both.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Don\(aqt use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the \fBAll\fP setting.
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MatchScope \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The parts of the JSON to match against using the \fBMatchPattern\fP . If you specify \fBAll\fP , AWS WAF matches against keys and values.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
InvalidFallbackBehavior \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
What AWS WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEVALUATE_AS_STRING\fP \- Inspect the body as plain text. AWS WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMATCH\fP \- Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. AWS WAF applies the rule action to the request.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBNO_MATCH\fP \- Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you don\(aqt provide this setting, AWS WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.
.sp
AWS WAF does its best to parse the entire JSON body, but might be forced to stop for reasons such as invalid characters, duplicate keys, truncation, and any content whose root node isn\(aqt an object or an array.
.sp
AWS WAF parses the JSON in the following examples as two valid key, value pairs:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Missing comma: \fB{"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Missing colon: \fB{"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Extra colons: \fB{"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}\fP

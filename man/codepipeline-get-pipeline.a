.SH NAME
codepipeline-get-pipeline \- Returns the metadata, structure, stages, and actions of a pipeline
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns the metadata, structure, stages, and actions of a pipeline. Can be used to return the entire structure of a pipeline in JSON format, which can then be modified and used to update the pipeline structure with  UpdatePipeline .
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the pipeline for which you want to get information. Pipeline names must be unique under an AWS user account.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-pipeline\-version\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The version number of the pipeline. If you do not specify a version, defaults to the current version.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

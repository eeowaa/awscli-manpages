.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-identity\-pool\-id\fP (string)
A name\-spaced GUID (for example, us\-east\-1:23EC4050\-6AEA\-7089\-A2DD\-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.
.sp
\fB\-\-identity\-id\fP (string)
A name\-spaced GUID (for example, us\-east\-1:23EC4050\-6AEA\-7089\-A2DD\-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.
.sp
\fB\-\-dataset\-name\fP (string)
A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed characters are a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9, \(aq_\(aq (underscore), \(aq\-\(aq (dash), and \(aq.\(aq (dot).
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Dataset \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A collection of data for an identity pool. An identity pool can have multiple datasets. A dataset is per identity and can be general or associated with a particular entity in an application (like a saved game). Datasets are automatically created if they don\(aqt exist. Data is synced by dataset, and a dataset can hold up to 1MB of key\-value pairs.

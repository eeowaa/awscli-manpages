.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new virtual MFA device for the AWS account. After creating the virtual MFA, use  EnableMFADevice to attach the MFA device to an IAM user. For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, see \fI\%Using a virtual MFA device\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
For information about the maximum number of MFA devices you can create, see \fI\%IAM and STS quotas\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The seed information contained in the QR code and the Base32 string should be treated like any other secret access information. In other words, protect the seed information as you would your AWS access keys or your passwords. After you provision your virtual device, you should ensure that the information is destroyed following secure procedures.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-path\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path for the virtual MFA device. For more information about paths, see \fI\%IAM identifiers\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\fB\eu0021\fP ) through the DEL character (\fB\eu007F\fP ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-virtual\-mfa\-device\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the virtual MFA device. Use with path to uniquely identify a virtual MFA device.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM virtual MFA device. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that represents user\-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, \fBDepartment\fP or \fBCost Center\fP are common choices.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of \fBDepartment\fP could have values such as \fBHuman Resources\fP , \fBAccounting\fP , and \fBSupport\fP . Tags with a key name of \fBCost Center\fP might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AWS always interprets the tag \fBValue\fP as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma\-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo create a virtual MFA device\fP
.sp
This example creates a new virtual MFA device called \fBBobsMFADevice\fP\&. It creates a file that contains bootstrap information called \fBQRCode.png\fP
and places it in the \fBC:/\fP directory. The bootstrap method used in this example is \fBQRCodePNG\fP:

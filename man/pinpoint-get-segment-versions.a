.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

SourceSegments \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The base segment to build the segment on. A base segment, also referred to as a \fIsource segment\fP , defines the initial population of endpoints for a segment. When you add dimensions to a segment, Amazon Pinpoint filters the base segment by using the dimensions that you specify.
.sp
You can specify more than one dimensional segment or only one imported segment. If you specify an imported segment, the Amazon Pinpoint console displays a segment size estimate that indicates the size of the imported segment without any filters applied to it.

.SH NAME
sagemaker-stop-hyper-parameter-tuning-job \- Stops a running hyperparameter tuning job and all running training jobs that the tuning job launched
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Stops a running hyperparameter tuning job and all running training jobs that the tuning job launched.
.sp
All model artifacts output from the training jobs are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). All data that the training jobs write to Amazon CloudWatch Logs are still available in CloudWatch. After the tuning job moves to the \fBStopped\fP state, it releases all reserved resources for the tuning job.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

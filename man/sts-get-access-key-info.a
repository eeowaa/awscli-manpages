.SH NAME
sts-get-access-key-info \- Returns the account identifier for the specified access key ID
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns the account identifier for the specified access key ID.
.sp
Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, \fBAKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\fP ) and a secret access key (for example, \fBwJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\fP ). For more information about access keys, see \fI\%Managing Access Keys for IAM Users\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
When you pass an access key ID to this operation, it returns the ID of the AWS account to which the keys belong. Access key IDs beginning with \fBAKIA\fP are long\-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. Access key IDs beginning with \fBASIA\fP are temporary credentials that are created using STS operations. If the account in the response belongs to you, you can sign in as the root user and review your root user access keys. Then, you can pull a \fI\%credentials report\fP to learn which IAM user owns the keys. To learn who requested the temporary credentials for an \fBASIA\fP access key, view the STS events in your \fI\%CloudTrail logs\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
This operation does not indicate the state of the access key. The key might be active, inactive, or deleted. Active keys might not have permissions to perform an operation. Providing a deleted access key might return an error that the key doesn\(aqt exist.

.sp
\fB\-\-access\-key\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier of an access key.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

gamelift-describe-matchmaking-rule-sets \- Retrieves the details for FlexMatch matchmaking rule sets
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the details for FlexMatch matchmaking rule sets. You can request all existing rule sets for the Region, or provide a list of one or more rule set names. When requesting multiple items, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a rule set is returned for each requested name.

\fBdescribe\-matchmaking\-rule\-sets\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBRuleSets\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
RuleSets \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A collection of requested matchmaking rule set objects.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine how to build your player matches. Each rule set describes a type of group to be created and defines the parameters for acceptable player matches. Rule sets are used in  MatchmakingConfiguration objects.
.sp
A rule set may define the following elements for a match. For detailed information and examples showing how to construct a rule set, see \fI\%Build a FlexMatch rule set\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Teams \-\- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the match and set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled.
.IP \(bu 2
Player attributes \-\- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute values. For example, an attribute might specify a player\(aqs skill or level.
.IP \(bu 2
Rules \-\- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire group\-\-such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role.
.IP \(bu 2
Expansions \-\- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of time when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.

.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (\fI\%ARN\fP ) that is assigned to a GameLift matchmaking rule set resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is \fBarn:aws:gamelift:<region>::matchmakingruleset/<ruleset name>\fP . In a GameLift rule set ARN, the resource ID matches the \fIRuleSetName\fP value.
.UNINDENT

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or \fIproducers\fP . Scale\-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in a stream.
.sp
You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed of. Each shard can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. If the amount of data input increases or decreases, you can add or remove shards.
.sp
The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account used by the application. It is also scoped by AWS Region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different Regions, can have the same name.

\fBCreateStream\fP is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a \fBCreateStream\fP request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to \fBCREATING\fP . After the stream is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to \fBACTIVE\fP . You should perform read and write operations only on an \fBACTIVE\fP stream.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You receive a \fBLimitExceededException\fP when making a \fBCreateStream\fP request when you try to do one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Have more than five streams in the \fBCREATING\fP state at any point in time.
.IP \(bu 2
Create more shards than are authorized for your account.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see \fI\%Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits\fP in the \fIAmazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide\fP . To increase this limit, \fI\%contact AWS Support\fP .
.sp
You can use \fBDescribeStream\fP to check the stream status, which is returned in \fBStreamStatus\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
CreateStream has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-stream\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A name to identify the stream. The stream name is scoped to the AWS account used by the application that creates the stream. It is also scoped by AWS Region. That is, two streams in two different AWS accounts can have the same name. Two streams in the same AWS account but in two different Regions can also have the same name.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-shard\-count\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of shards that the stream will use. The throughput of the stream is a function of the number of shards; more shards are required for greater provisioned throughput.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

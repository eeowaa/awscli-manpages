.SH EXAMPLES

\fBTo set up the credential helper included in the AWS CLI with AWS CodeCommit\fP
.sp
The \fBcredential\-helper\fP utility is not designed to be called directly from the AWS CLI. Instead it is intended to be used as a parameter with the \fBgit config\fP command to set up your local computer. It enables Git to use HTTPS and a cryptographically signed version of your IAM user credentials or Amazon EC2 instance role whenever Git needs to authenticate with AWS to interact with CodeCommit repositories.

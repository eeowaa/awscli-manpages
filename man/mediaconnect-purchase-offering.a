.sp
\fB\-\-offering\-arn\fP (string)
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the offering.
.sp
\fB\-\-reservation\-name\fP (string)
The name that you want to use for the reservation.
.sp
\fB\-\-start\fP (string)
The date and time that you want the reservation to begin, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You can specify any date and time between 12:00am on the first day of the current month to the current time on today\(aqs date, inclusive. Specify the start in a 24\-hour notation. Use the following format: YYYY\-MM\-DDTHH:mm:SSZ, where T and Z are literal characters. For example, to specify 11:30pm on March 5, 2020, enter 2020\-03\-05T23:30:00Z.
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
lex-models-delete-bot \- Deletes all versions of the bot, including the $LATEST version
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes all versions of the bot, including the \fB$LATEST\fP version. To delete a specific version of the bot, use the  DeleteBotVersion operation. The \fBDeleteBot\fP operation doesn\(aqt immediately remove the bot schema. Instead, it is marked for deletion and removed later.
.sp
Amazon Lex stores utterances indefinitely for improving the ability of your bot to respond to user inputs. These utterances are not removed when the bot is deleted. To remove the utterances, use the  DeleteUtterances operation.
.sp
If a bot has an alias, you can\(aqt delete it. Instead, the \fBDeleteBot\fP operation returns a \fBResourceInUseException\fP exception that includes a reference to the alias that refers to the bot. To remove the reference to the bot, delete the alias. If you get the same exception again, delete the referring alias until the \fBDeleteBot\fP operation is successful.
.sp
This operation requires permissions for the \fBlex:DeleteBot\fP action.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

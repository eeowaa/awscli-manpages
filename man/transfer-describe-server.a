.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes a file transfer protocol\-enabled server that you specify by passing the \fBServerId\fP parameter.
.sp
The response contains a description of a server\(aqs properties. When you set \fBEndpointType\fP to VPC, the response will contain the \fBEndpointDetails\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-server\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A system\-assigned unique identifier for a server.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

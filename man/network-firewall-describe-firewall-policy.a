.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-policy\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The descriptive name of the firewall policy. You can\(aqt change the name of a firewall policy after you create it.
.sp
You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-policy\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.
.sp
You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
UpdateToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall policy. The token marks the state of the policy resource at the time of the request.
.sp
To make changes to the policy, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the policy hasn\(aqt changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an \fBInvalidTokenException\fP . If this happens, retrieve the firewall policy again to get a current copy of it with current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.
.UNINDENT

.sp

.INDENT 3.5
The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define.

You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource.
.sp
Key \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The policy for the specified firewall policy.
.sp
StatelessRuleGroupReferences \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
References to the stateless rule groups that are used in the policy. These define the matching criteria in stateless rules.
.sp

Identifier for a single stateless rule group, used in a firewall policy to refer to the rule group.
.sp
ResourceArn \-> (string)

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stateless rule group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Priority \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An integer setting that indicates the order in which to run the stateless rule groups in a single  FirewallPolicy . Network Firewall applies each stateless rule group to a packet starting with the group that has the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique within each policy.

.sp
StatelessDefaultActions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The actions to take on a packet if it doesn\(aqt match any of the stateless rules in the policy. If you want non\-matching packets to be forwarded for stateful inspection, specify \fBaws:forward_to_sfe\fP .
.sp
You must specify one of the standard actions: \fBaws:pass\fP , \fBaws:drop\fP , or \fBaws:forward_to_sfe\fP . In addition, you can specify custom actions that are compatible with your standard section choice.
.sp
For example, you could specify \fB["aws:pass"]\fP or you could specify \fB["aws:pass", “customActionName”]\fP . For information about compatibility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .
.sp
(string)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
StatelessFragmentDefaultActions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The actions to take on a fragmented UDP packet if it doesn\(aqt match any of the stateless rules in the policy. Network Firewall only manages UDP packet fragments and silently drops packet fragments for other protocols. If you want non\-matching fragmented UDP packets to be forwarded for stateful inspection, specify \fBaws:forward_to_sfe\fP .
.sp
You must specify one of the standard actions: \fBaws:pass\fP , \fBaws:drop\fP , or \fBaws:forward_to_sfe\fP . In addition, you can specify custom actions that are compatible with your standard section choice.
.sp
For example, you could specify \fB["aws:pass"]\fP or you could specify \fB["aws:pass", “customActionName”]\fP . For information about compatibility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
StatelessCustomActions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The custom action definitions that are available for use in the firewall policy\(aqs \fBStatelessDefaultActions\fP setting. You name each custom action that you define, and then you can use it by name in your default actions specifications.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An optional, non\-standard action to use for stateless packet handling. You can define this in addition to the standard action that you must specify.
.sp
You define and name the custom actions that you want to be able to use, and then you reference them by name in your actions settings.
.sp
You can use custom actions in the following places:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
In a rule group\(aqs  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The custom actions are available for use by name inside the \fBStatelessRulesAndCustomActions\fP where you define them. You can use them for your stateless rule actions to specify what to do with a packet that matches the rule\(aqs match attributes.
.IP \(bu 2
In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in \fBStatelessCustomActions\fP . The custom actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them. You can use them for the policy\(aqs default stateless actions settings to specify what to do with packets that don\(aqt match any of the policy\(aqs stateless rules.
.UNINDENT
.sp
ActionName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The descriptive name of the custom action. You can\(aqt change the name of a custom action after you create it.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ActionDefinition \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The custom action associated with the action name.
.sp
PublishMetricAction \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. This setting defines a CloudWatch dimension value to be published.
.sp
You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it.
.sp
Dimensions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to \fBCustomAction\fP and you provide the dimension value.
.sp
For more information about CloudWatch custom metric dimensions, see \fI\%Publishing Custom Metrics\fP in the \fI\%Amazon CloudWatch User Guide\fP .
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Associates a Resolver rule with a VPC. When you associate a rule with a VPC, Resolver forwards all DNS queries for the domain name that is specified in the rule and that originate in the VPC. The queries are forwarded to the IP addresses for the DNS resolvers that are specified in the rule. For more information about rules, see \fI\%CreateResolverRule\fP .
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-resolver\-rule\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the Resolver rule that you want to associate with the VPC. To list the existing Resolver rules, use \fI\%ListResolverRules\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A name for the association that you\(aqre creating between a Resolver rule and a VPC.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-vpc\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the VPC that you want to associate the Resolver rule with.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo associate a Resolver rule with a VPC\fP
.sp
The following \fBassociate\-resolver\-rule\fP example associates a Resolver rule with an Amazon VPC. After you run the command, Resolver starts to forward DNS queries to your network based on the settings in the rule, such as the domain name of the queries that are forwarded.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Removes locations from a multi\-location fleet. When deleting a location, all game server process and all instances that are still active in the location are shut down.
.sp
To delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of the locations to be deleted.
.sp
If successful, GameLift sets the location status to \fBDELETING\fP , and begins to shut down existing server processes and terminate instances in each location being deleted. When completed, the location status changes to \fBTERMINATED\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
A fleet location and its life\-cycle state. A location state object might be used to describe a fleet\(aqs remote location or home Region. Life\-cycle state tracks the progress of launching the first instance in a new location and preparing it for game hosting, and then removing all instances and deleting the location from the fleet.

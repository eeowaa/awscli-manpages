.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx file systems, if a \fBFileSystemIds\fP value is provided for that file system. Otherwise, it returns descriptions of all file systems owned by your AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you\(aqre calling.
.sp
When retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally specify the \fBMaxResults\fP parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a response. If more file system descriptions remain, Amazon FSx returns a \fBNextToken\fP value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the \fBNextToken\fP request parameter set to the value of \fBNextToken\fP from the last response.
.sp
This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your file system descriptions. \fBDescribeFileSystems\fP is called first without a \fBNextToken\fP value. Then the action continues to be called with the \fBNextToken\fP parameter set to the value of the last \fBNextToken\fP value until a response has no \fBNextToken\fP .
.sp
When using this action, keep the following in mind:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The implementation might return fewer than \fBMaxResults\fP file system descriptions while still including a \fBNextToken\fP value.
.IP \(bu 2
The order of file systems returned in the response of one \fBDescribeFileSystems\fP call and the order of file systems returned across the responses of a multicall iteration is unspecified.

\fBdescribe\-file\-systems\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBFileSystems\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0

Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBSCRATCH_1\fP and \fBSCRATCH_2\fP deployment types are best suited for when you need temporary storage and shorter\-term processing of data. The \fBSCRATCH_2\fP deployment type provides in\-transit encryption of data and higher burst throughput capacity than \fBSCRATCH_1\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBPERSISTENT_1\fP deployment type is used for longer\-term storage and workloads and encryption of data in transit. To learn more about deployment types, see \fI\%FSx for Lustre Deployment Options\fP . (Default = \fBSCRATCH_1\fP )

.INDENT 3.5
Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per second of read or write throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system throughput capacity is equal to Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). This option is only valid for \fBPERSISTENT_1\fP deployment types.
.sp
Valid values for SSD storage: 50, 100, 200. Valid values for HDD storage: 12, 40.

DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A recurring daily time, in the format \fBHH:MM\fP . \fBHH\fP is the zero\-padded hour of the day (0\-23), and \fBMM\fP is the zero\-padded minute of the hour. For example, \fB05:00\fP specifies 5 AM daily.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CopyTagsToBackups \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be copied to backups. If it\(aqs set to true, all tags on the file system are copied to all automatic backups and any user\-initiated backups where the user doesn\(aqt specify any tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user\-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system, regardless of this value. (Default = false)

DriveCacheType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems that are provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter is required when storage type is HDD. Set to \fBREAD\fP , improve the performance for frequently accessed files and allows 20% of the total storage capacity of the file system to be cached.

AdministrativeActionType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE\fP \- A file system update administrative action initiated by the user from the Amazon FSx console, API (UpdateFileSystem), or CLI (update\-file\-system).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSTORAGE_OPTIMIZATION\fP \- Once the \fBFILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE\fP task to increase a file system\(aqs storage capacity completes successfully, a \fBSTORAGE_OPTIMIZATION\fP task starts.
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
For Windows, storage optimization is the process of migrating the file system data to the new, larger disks.
.IP \(bu 2
For Lustre, storage optimization consists of rebalancing the data across the existing and newly added file servers.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gets an origin request policy configuration.
.sp
To get an origin request policy configuration, you must provide the policy’s identifier. If the origin request policy is attached to a distribution’s cache behavior, you can get the policy’s identifier using \fBListDistributions\fP or \fBGetDistribution\fP . If the origin request policy is not attached to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using \fBListOriginRequestPolicies\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the origin request policy. If the origin request policy is attached to a distribution’s cache behavior, you can get the policy’s identifier using \fBListDistributions\fP or \fBGetDistribution\fP . If the origin request policy is not attached to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using \fBListOriginRequestPolicies\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

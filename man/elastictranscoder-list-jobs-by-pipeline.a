.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The ListJobsByPipeline operation gets a list of the jobs currently in a pipeline.
.sp
Elastic Transcoder returns all of the jobs currently in the specified pipeline. The response body contains one element for each job that satisfies the search criteria.

.sp
\fBlist\-jobs\-by\-pipeline\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBJobs\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

InputCaptions \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All captions must be in UTF\-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two types of captions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEmbedded:\fP Embedded captions are included in the same file as the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded captions per file.

.IP \(bu 2
\fBSidecar:\fP Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file from the audio and video data. Sidecar captions require a player that is capable of understanding the relationship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid input values include: \fBdfxp\fP (first div element only), \fBebu\-tt\fP , \fBscc\fP , \fBsmpt\fP , \fBsrt\fP , \fBttml\fP (first div element only), and \fBwebvtt\fP   Valid outputs include: \fBdfxp\fP (first div element only), \fBscc\fP , \fBsrt\fP , and \fBwebvtt\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want ttml or smpte\-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format.
.sp
Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for captions, and is not available for audio\-only transcoding. Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during the transcoding process.
.sp
To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set \fBCaptions\fP to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the \fBMergePolicy\fP to \fBMergeRetain\fP , and pass in a null \fBCaptionSources\fP array.

.INDENT 3.5
A policy that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles the existence of multiple captions.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMergeOverride:\fP Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the embedded captions for that language.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMergeRetain:\fP Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the embedded captions and ignores the sidecar captions for that language. If \fBCaptionSources\fP is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all sidecar captions from the output files.

Information about the watermarks that you want Elastic Transcoder to add to the video during transcoding. You can specify up to four watermarks for each output. Settings for each watermark must be defined in the preset that you specify in \fBPreset\fP for the current output.
.sp
Watermarks are added to the output video in the sequence in which you list them in the job output—the first watermark in the list is added to the output video first, the second watermark in the list is added next, and so on. As a result, if the settings in a preset cause Elastic Transcoder to place all watermarks in the same location, the second watermark that you add covers the first one, the third one covers the second, and the fourth one covers the third.

\fBStretch:\fP Elastic Transcoder stretches the output art to match the values that you specified for \fBMaxWidth\fP and \fBMaxHeight\fP . If the relative proportions of the input art and the output art are different, the output art will be distorted.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBKeep:\fP Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output art. If either dimension of the input art exceeds the values that you specified for \fBMaxWidth\fP and \fBMaxHeight\fP , Elastic Transcoder crops the output art.

\fBShrinkToFit:\fP Elastic Transcoder scales the output art down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of \fBMaxWidth\fP and \fBMaxHeight\fP without exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the art up.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBShrinkToFill\fP Elastic Transcoder scales the output art down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of \fBMaxWidth\fP and \fBMaxHeight\fP without dropping below either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the art up.

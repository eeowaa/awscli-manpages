.SH NAME
kinesisvideo-delete-stream \- Deletes a Kinesis video stream and the data contained in the stream
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a Kinesis video stream and the data contained in the stream.
.sp
This method marks the stream for deletion, and makes the data in the stream inaccessible immediately.
.sp
To ensure that you have the latest version of the stream before deleting it, you can specify the stream version. Kinesis Video Streams assigns a version to each stream. When you update a stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns a new version number. To get the latest stream version, use the \fBDescribeStream\fP API.
.sp
This operation requires permission for the \fBKinesisVideo:DeleteStream\fP action.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
mturk-approve-assignment \- The ApproveAssignment operation approves the results of a completed assignment
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBApproveAssignment\fP operation approves the results of a completed assignment.
.sp
Approving an assignment initiates two payments from the Requester\(aqs Amazon.com account
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The Worker who submitted the results is paid the reward specified in the HIT.
.IP \(bu 2
Amazon Mechanical Turk fees are debited.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the Requester\(aqs account does not have adequate funds for these payments, the call to ApproveAssignment returns an exception, and the approval is not processed. You can include an optional feedback message with the approval, which the Worker can see in the Status section of the web site.
.sp
You can also call this operation for assignments that were previous rejected and approve them by explicitly overriding the previous rejection. This only works on rejected assignments that were submitted within the previous 30 days and only if the assignment\(aqs related HIT has not been deleted.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

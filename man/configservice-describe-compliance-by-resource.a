.SH NAME
configservice-describe-compliance-by-resource \- Indicates whether the specified AWS resources are compliant
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Indicates whether the specified AWS resources are compliant. If a resource is noncompliant, this action returns the number of AWS Config rules that the resource does not comply with.
.sp
A resource is compliant if it complies with all the AWS Config rules that evaluate it. It is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.
.sp
If AWS Config has no current evaluation results for the resource, it returns \fBINSUFFICIENT_DATA\fP . This result might indicate one of the following conditions about the rules that evaluate the resource:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
AWS Config has never invoked an evaluation for the rule. To check whether it has, use the \fBDescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus\fP action to get the \fBLastSuccessfulInvocationTime\fP and \fBLastFailedInvocationTime\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
The rule\(aqs AWS Lambda function is failing to send evaluation results to AWS Config. Verify that the role that you assigned to your configuration recorder includes the \fBconfig:PutEvaluations\fP permission. If the rule is a custom rule, verify that the AWS Lambda execution role includes the \fBconfig:PutEvaluations\fP permission.
.IP \(bu 2
The rule\(aqs AWS Lambda function has returned \fBNOT_APPLICABLE\fP for all evaluation results. This can occur if the resources were deleted or removed from the rule\(aqs scope.

\fBdescribe\-compliance\-by\-resource\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBComplianceByResources\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-resource\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The types of AWS resources for which you want compliance information (for example, \fBAWS::EC2::Instance\fP ). For this action, you can specify that the resource type is an AWS account by specifying \fBAWS::::Account\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-resource\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the AWS resource for which you want compliance information. You can specify only one resource ID. If you specify a resource ID, you must also specify a type for \fBResourceType\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-compliance\-types\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Filters the results by compliance.
.sp
The allowed values are \fBCOMPLIANT\fP , \fBNON_COMPLIANT\fP , and \fBINSUFFICIENT_DATA\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo get compliance information for your AWS resources\fP
.sp
The following command returns compliance information for each EC2 instance that is recorded by AWS Config and that violates one or more rules:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws configservice describe\-compliance\-by\-resource \-\-resource\-type AWS::EC2::Instance \-\-compliance\-types NON_COMPLIANT
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the output, the value for each \fBCappedCount\fP attribute indicates how many rules the resource violates. For example, the following output indicates that instance \fBi\-1a2b3c4d\fP violates 2 rules.
.sp
Output:
.INDENT 0.0

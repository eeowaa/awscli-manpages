\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

ignoreApplicationStopFailures \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If true, then if an \fBApplicationStop\fP , \fBBeforeBlockTraffic\fP , or \fBAfterBlockTraffic\fP deployment lifecycle event to an instance fails, then the deployment continues to the next deployment lifecycle event. For example, if \fBApplicationStop\fP fails, the deployment continues with DownloadBundle. If \fBBeforeBlockTraffic\fP fails, the deployment continues with \fBBlockTraffic\fP . If \fBAfterBlockTraffic\fP fails, the deployment continues with \fBApplicationStop\fP .
.sp
If false or not specified, then if a lifecycle event fails during a deployment to an instance, that deployment fails. If deployment to that instance is part of an overall deployment and the number of healthy hosts is not less than the minimum number of healthy hosts, then a deployment to the next instance is attempted.
.sp
During a deployment, the AWS CodeDeploy agent runs the scripts specified for \fBApplicationStop\fP , \fBBeforeBlockTraffic\fP , and \fBAfterBlockTraffic\fP in the AppSpec file from the previous successful deployment. (All other scripts are run from the AppSpec file in the current deployment.) If one of these scripts contains an error and does not run successfully, the deployment can fail.
.sp
If the cause of the failure is a script from the last successful deployment that will never run successfully, create a new deployment and use \fBignoreApplicationStopFailures\fP to specify that the \fBApplicationStop\fP , \fBBeforeBlockTraffic\fP , and \fBAfterBlockTraffic\fP failures should be ignored.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists all of the versions attached to the specified secret. The output does not include the \fBSecretString\fP or \fBSecretBinary\fP fields. By default, the list includes only versions that have at least one staging label in \fBVersionStage\fP attached.

Always check the \fBNextToken\fP response parameter when calling any of the \fBList*\fP operations. These operations can occasionally return an empty or shorter than expected list of results even when there more results become available. When this happens, the \fBNextToken\fP response parameter contains a value to pass to the next call to the same API to request the next part of the list.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-secret\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier for the secret containing the versions you want to list. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
.sp
If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the \(aqfriendly name\(aq, you \fImust\fP not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a \fIResourceNotFoundException\fP or an \fIAccessDeniedException\fP error, depending on your permissions.

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Limits the number of results you want to include in the response. If you don\(aqt include this parameter, it defaults to a value that\(aqs specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the \fBNextToken\fP response element is present and has a value (isn\(aqt null). Include that value as the \fBNextToken\fP request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Secrets Manager might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check \fBNextToken\fP after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Use this parameter in a request if you receive a \fBNextToken\fP response in a previous request indicating there\(aqs more output available. In a subsequent call, set it to the value of the previous call \fBNextToken\fP response to indicate where the output should continue from.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-include\-deprecated\fP | \fB\-\-no\-include\-deprecated\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Specifies that you want the results to include versions that do not have any staging labels attached to them. Such versions are considered deprecated and are subject to deletion by Secrets Manager as needed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Versions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of the currently available versions of the specified secret.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that contains information about one version of a secret.
.sp
VersionId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique version identifier of this version of the secret.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
VersionStages \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of staging labels that are currently associated with this version of the secret.
.sp
(string)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
LastAccessedDate \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The date that this version of the secret was last accessed. Note that the resolution of this field is at the date level and does not include the time.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CreatedDate \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The date and time this version of the secret was created.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.sp
NextToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If present in the response, this value indicates that there\(aqs more output available than included in the current response. This can occur even when the response includes no values at all, such as when you ask for a filtered view of a very long list. Use this value in the \fBNextToken\fP request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to continue processing and get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the \fBNextToken\fP response element comes back empty (as \fBnull\fP ).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ARN \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the secret.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Secrets Manager automatically adds several random characters to the name at the end of the ARN when you initially create a secret. This affects only the ARN and not the actual friendly name. This ensures that if you create a new secret with the same name as an old secret that you previously deleted, then users with access to the old secret \fIdon\(aqt\fP automatically get access to the new secret because the ARNs are different.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The friendly name of the secret.

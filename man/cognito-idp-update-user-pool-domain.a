.SH NAME
cognito-idp-update-user-pool-domain \- Updates the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate for the custom domain for your user pool
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate for the custom domain for your user pool.
.sp
You can use this operation to provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a new certificate to Amazon Cognito. You cannot use it to change the domain for a user pool.
.sp
A custom domain is used to host the Amazon Cognito hosted UI, which provides sign\-up and sign\-in pages for your application. When you set up a custom domain, you provide a certificate that you manage with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). When necessary, you can use this operation to change the certificate that you applied to your custom domain.
.sp
Usually, this is unnecessary following routine certificate renewal with ACM. When you renew your existing certificate in ACM, the ARN for your certificate remains the same, and your custom domain uses the new certificate automatically.
.sp
However, if you replace your existing certificate with a new one, ACM gives the new certificate a new ARN. To apply the new certificate to your custom domain, you must provide this ARN to Amazon Cognito.
.sp
When you add your new certificate in ACM, you must choose US East (N. Virginia) as the AWS Region.
.sp
After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your custom domain.
.sp
For more information about adding a custom domain to your user pool, see \fI\%Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

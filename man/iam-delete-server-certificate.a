\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you are using a server certificate with Elastic Load Balancing, deleting the certificate could have implications for your application. If Elastic Load Balancing doesn\(aqt detect the deletion of bound certificates, it may continue to use the certificates. This could cause Elastic Load Balancing to stop accepting traffic. We recommend that you remove the reference to the certificate from Elastic Load Balancing before using this command to delete the certificate. For more information, see \fI\%DeleteLoadBalancerListeners\fP in the \fIElastic Load Balancing API Reference\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

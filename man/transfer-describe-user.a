A system\-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this user assigned.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-user\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the user assigned to one or more servers. User names are part of the sign\-in credentials to use the AWS Transfer Family service and perform file transfer tasks.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

User \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array containing the properties of the user account for the \fBServerID\fP value that you specified.
.sp
Arn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user that was requested to be described.
.UNINDENT

.sp
HomeDirectory \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the landing directory (or folder), which is the location that files are written to or read from in an Amazon S3 bucket, for the described user. An example is * \fByour\-Amazon\-S3\-bucket\-name>/home/username\fP * .
.UNINDENT

.sp
HomeDirectoryMappings \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You will need to specify the "\fBEntry\fP " and "\fBTarget\fP " pair, where \fBEntry\fP shows how the path is made visible and \fBTarget\fP is the actual Amazon S3 or EFS path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in \fBTarget\fP .
.sp
In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope\-down policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("\fBchroot\fP "). To do this, you can set \fBEntry\fP to \(aq/\(aq and set \fBTarget\fP to the HomeDirectory parameter value.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents an object that contains entries and targets for \fBHomeDirectoryMappings\fP .
.sp

HomeDirectoryType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the type of landing directory (folder) you mapped for your users to see when they log into the file transfer protocol\-enabled server. If you set it to \fBPATH\fP , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it \fBLOGICAL\fP , you will need to provide mappings in the \fBHomeDirectoryMappings\fP for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.

.INDENT 3.5
The IAM role that controls your users\(aq access to your Amazon S3 bucket. The policies attached to this role will determine the level of access you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or buckets. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows a server to access your resources when servicing your users\(aq transfer requests.

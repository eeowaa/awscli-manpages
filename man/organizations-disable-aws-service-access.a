.SH NAME
organizations-disable-aws-service-access \- Disables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified by ServicePrincipal ) with AWS Organizations
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Disables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified by \fBServicePrincipal\fP ) with AWS Organizations. When you disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a \fI\%service\-linked role\fP in \fInew\fP accounts in your organization. This means the service can\(aqt perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean\-up from AWS Organizations.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
We ** \fIstrongly recommend\fP ** that you don\(aqt use this command to disable integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS service. Instead, use the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. This lets the trusted service perform any required initialization when enabling trusted access, such as creating any required resources and any required clean up of resources when disabling trusted access.
.sp
For information about how to disable trusted service access to your organization using the trusted service, see the \fBLearn more\fP link under the \fBSupports Trusted Access\fP column at \fI\%AWS services that you can use with AWS Organizations\fP . on this page.

If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following actions to occur:

The service can no longer create a service\-linked role in the accounts in your organization. This means that the service can\(aqt perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean\-up from AWS Organizations.
.IP \(bu 2
The service can no longer perform tasks in the member accounts in the organization, unless those operations are explicitly permitted by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles. This includes any data aggregation from the member accounts to the management account, or to a delegated administrator account, where relevant.
.IP \(bu 2
Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data or resources related to the integration, while other services stop accessing the organization but leave any historical data and configuration in place to support a possible re\-enabling of the integration.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using the other service\(aqs console or commands to disable the integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its resources in the organization\(aqs accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other AWS service.

After you perform the \fBDisableAWSServiceAccess\fP operation, the specified service can no longer perform operations in your organization\(aqs accounts

.sp
\fB\-\-service\-principal\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The service principal name of the AWS service for which you want to disable integration with your organization. This is typically in the form of a URL, such as \(ga\(ga \fIservice\-abbreviation\fP .amazonaws.com\(ga\(ga .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

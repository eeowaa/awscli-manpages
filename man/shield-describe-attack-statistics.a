.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Provides information about the number and type of attacks AWS Shield has detected in the last year for all resources that belong to your account, regardless of whether you\(aqve defined Shield protections for them. This operation is available to Shield customers as well as to Shield Advanced customers.
.sp
The operation returns data for the time range of midnight UTC, one year ago, to midnight UTC, today. For example, if the current time is \fB2020\-10\-26 15:39:32 PDT\fP , equal to \fB2020\-10\-26 22:39:32 UTC\fP , then the time range for the attack data returned is from \fB2019\-10\-26 00:00:00 UTC\fP to \fB2020\-10\-26 00:00:00 UTC\fP .
.sp
The time range indicates the period covered by the attack statistics data items.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
The data that describes the attacks detected during the time period.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A single attack statistics data record. This is returned by  DescribeAttackStatistics along with a time range indicating the time period that the attack statistics apply to.
.sp
AttackVolume \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Information about the volume of attacks during the time period. If the accompanying \fBAttackCount\fP is zero, this setting might be empty.
.sp
BitsPerSecond \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A statistics object that uses bits per second as the unit. This is included for network level attacks.
.sp
Max \-> (double)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum attack volume observed for the given unit.

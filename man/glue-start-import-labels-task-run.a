.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Enables you to provide additional labels (examples of truth) to be used to teach the machine learning transform and improve its quality. This API operation is generally used as part of the active learning workflow that starts with the \fBStartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun\fP call and that ultimately results in improving the quality of your machine learning transform.
.sp
After the \fBStartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun\fP finishes, AWS Glue machine learning will have generated a series of questions for humans to answer. (Answering these questions is often called \(aqlabeling\(aq in the machine learning workflows). In the case of the \fBFindMatches\fP transform, these questions are of the form, “What is the correct way to group these rows together into groups composed entirely of matching records?” After the labeling process is finished, users upload their answers/labels with a call to \fBStartImportLabelsTaskRun\fP . After \fBStartImportLabelsTaskRun\fP finishes, all future runs of the machine learning transform use the new and improved labels and perform a higher\-quality transformation.
.sp
By default, \fBStartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun\fP continually learns from and combines all labels that you upload unless you set \fBReplace\fP to true. If you set \fBReplace\fP to true, \fBStartImportLabelsTaskRun\fP deletes and forgets all previously uploaded labels and learns only from the exact set that you upload. Replacing labels can be helpful if you realize that you previously uploaded incorrect labels, and you believe that they are having a negative effect on your transform quality.
.sp
You can check on the status of your task run by calling the \fBGetMLTaskRun\fP operation.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

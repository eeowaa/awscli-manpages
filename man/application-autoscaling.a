.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Register and manage scalable targets \- Register AWS or custom resources as scalable targets (a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and retrieve information on existing scalable targets.
.IP \(bu 2
Configure and manage automatic scaling \- Define scaling policies to dynamically scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms, schedule one\-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your recent scaling activity history.
.IP \(bu 2
Suspend and resume scaling \- Temporarily suspend and later resume automatic scaling by calling the \fI\%RegisterScalableTarget\fP API action for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and resume (individually or in combination) scale\-out activities that are triggered by a scaling policy, scale\-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.

.IP \(bu 2
Configure and manage automatic scaling \- Define scaling policies to dynamically scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms, schedule one\-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your recent scaling activity history.
.IP \(bu 2
Suspend and resume scaling \- Temporarily suspend and later resume automatic scaling by calling the \fI\%RegisterScalableTarget\fP API action for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and resume (individually or in combination) scale\-out activities that are triggered by a scaling policy, scale\-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.

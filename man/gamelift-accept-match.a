.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Registers a player\(aqs acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.
.sp
When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status \fBREQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE\fP . This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.
.sp
To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status \fBPLACING\fP , where a new game session is created for the match.
.sp
If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to \fBSEARCHING\fP to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to \fBCANCELLED\fP , and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

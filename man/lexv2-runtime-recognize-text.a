.SH NAME
lexv2-runtime-recognize-text \- Sends user input to Amazon Lex
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Sends user input to Amazon Lex. Client applications use this API to send requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex then interprets the user input using the machine learning model that it build for the bot.
.sp
In response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user and an optional response card to display.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values.

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
ses-get-identity-verification-attributes \- Given a list of identities (email addresses and/or domains), returns the verification status and (for domain identities) the verification token for each identity
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Given a list of identities (email addresses and/or domains), returns the verification status and (for domain identities) the verification token for each identity.
.sp
The verification status of an email address is "Pending" until the email address owner clicks the link within the verification email that Amazon SES sent to that address. If the email address owner clicks the link within 24 hours, the verification status of the email address changes to "Success". If the link is not clicked within 24 hours, the verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, if you still want to verify the email address, you must restart the verification process from the beginning.
.sp
For domain identities, the domain\(aqs verification status is "Pending" as Amazon SES searches for the required TXT record in the DNS settings of the domain. When Amazon SES detects the record, the domain\(aqs verification status changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is unable to detect the record within 72 hours, the domain\(aqs verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, if you still want to verify the domain, you must restart the verification process from the beginning.
.sp
This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only get verification attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo get the Amazon SES verification status for a list of identities\fP
.sp
The following example uses the \fBget\-identity\-verification\-attributes\fP command to retrieve the Amazon SES verification status for a list of identities:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws ses get\-identity\-verification\-attributes \-\-identities "user1@example.com" "user2@example.com"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
   "VerificationAttributes": {
       "user1@example.com": {
           "VerificationStatus": "Success"
       },
       "user2@example.com": {
           "VerificationStatus": "Pending"
       }
   }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.sp
If you call this command with an identity that you have never submitted for verification, that identity won\(aqt appear in the output.

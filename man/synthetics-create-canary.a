.SH NAME
synthetics-create-canary \- Creates a canary
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside\-in. Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once.
.sp
Do not use \fBCreateCanary\fP to modify an existing canary. Use \fI\%UpdateCanary\fP instead.
.sp
To create canaries, you must have the \fBCloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess\fP policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the the \fBiam:CreateRole\fP , \fBiam:CreatePolicy\fP and \fBiam:AttachRolePolicy\fP permissions. For more information, see \fI\%Necessary Roles and Permissions\fP .
.sp
Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet. For more information, see \fI\%Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries\fP .
.sp

\fB\-\-schedule\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that contains information about how often the canary is to run and when these test runs are to stop.
.sp
Expression \-> (string)

.sp
For example, \fBrate(1 minute)\fP runs the canary once a minute, \fBrate(10 minutes)\fP runs it once every 10 minutes, and \fBrate(1 hour)\fP runs it once every hour. You can specify a frequency between \fBrate(1 minute)\fP and \fBrate(1 hour)\fP .
.sp
Specifying \fBrate(0 minute)\fP or \fBrate(0 hour)\fP is a special value that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
DurationInSeconds \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
How long, in seconds, for the canary to continue making regular runs according to the schedule in the \fBExpression\fP value. If you specify 0, the canary continues making runs until you stop it. If you omit this field, the default of 0 is used.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

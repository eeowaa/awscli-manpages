.SH NAME
efs-create-mount-target \- Creates a mount target for a file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system on EC2 instances by using the mount target.
.sp
You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their file system.
.sp
You can create only one mount target for an EFS file system using One Zone storage classes. You must create that mount target in the same Availability Zone in which the file system is located. Use the \fBAvailabilityZoneName\fP and \fBAvailabiltyZoneId\fP properties in the  DescribeFileSystems response object to get this information. Use the \fBsubnetId\fP associated with the file system\(aqs Availability Zone when creating the mount target.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Amazon EFS: How it Works\fP .
.sp
To create a mount target for a file system, the file system\(aqs lifecycle state must be \fBavailable\fP . For more information, see  DescribeFileSystems .
.sp
In the request, provide the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The file system ID for which you are creating the mount target.
.IP \(bu 2
A subnet ID, which determines the following:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
The VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
.IP \(bu 2
The Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
.IP \(bu 2
The IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the mount target (if you don\(aqt specify an IP address in the request)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a \fBMountTargetId\fP and an \fBIpAddress\fP . You use this IP address when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target\(aqs DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve the mount target\(aqs DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see \fI\%How it Works: Implementation Overview\fP .
.sp
Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must meet the following requirements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets
.IP \(bu 2
Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the existing mount targets
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.
.IP \(bu 2
Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the request provides an \fBIpAddress\fP , Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 \fBCreateNetworkInterface\fP call does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).
.IP \(bu 2
If the request provides \fBSecurityGroups\fP , this network interface is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security group for the subnet\(aqs VPC.
.IP \(bu 2
Assigns the description \fBMount target *fsmt\-id* for file system *fs\-id* \(ga\(ga where \(ga\(ga *fsmt\-id* \(ga\(ga is the mount target ID, and \(ga\(ga *fs\-id* \(ga\(ga is the \(ga\(gaFileSystemId\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
Sets the \fBrequesterManaged\fP property of the network interface to \fBtrue\fP , and the \fBrequesterId\fP value to \fBEFS\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester\-managed EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the \fBNetworkInterfaceId\fP field in the mount target\(aqs description to the network interface ID, and the \fBIpAddress\fP field to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire \fBCreateMountTarget\fP operation fails.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBCreateMountTarget\fP call returns only after creating the network interface, but while the mount target state is still \fBcreating\fP , you can check the mount target creation status by calling the  DescribeMountTargets operation, which among other things returns the mount target state.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon EFS\fP . In addition, by always using a mount target local to the instance\(aqs Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount target is created goes down, then you can\(aqt access your file system through that mount target.

This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file system:

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

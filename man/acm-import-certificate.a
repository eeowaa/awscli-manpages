.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Imports a certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with services that are integrated with ACM. Note that \fI\%integrated services\fP allow only certificate types and keys they support to be associated with their resources. Further, their support differs depending on whether the certificate is imported into IAM or into ACM. For more information, see the documentation for each service. For more information about importing certificates into ACM, see \fI\%Importing Certificates\fP in the \fIAWS Certificate Manager User Guide\fP .

ACM does not provide \fI\%managed renewal\fP for certificates that you import.

Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.
.IP \(bu 2
The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.
.IP \(bu 2
The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5,120 bytes).
.IP \(bu 2
If the certificate you are importing is not self\-signed, you must enter its certificate chain.
.IP \(bu 2
If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain.
.IP \(bu 2
The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM\-encoded.
.IP \(bu 2
The current time must be between the \fBNot Before\fP and \fBNot After\fP certificate fields.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBIssuer\fP field must not be empty.
.IP \(bu 2
The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.
.IP \(bu 2
To import a new certificate, omit the \fBCertificateArn\fP argument. Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.
.IP \(bu 2
When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names preceded by \fBfileb://\fP . For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the \fBC:\etemp\fP folder as \fBfileb://C:\etemp\ecertificate_to_import.pem\fP . If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs.
.IP \(bu 2
When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner required by the programming language you\(aqre using.
.IP \(bu 2
The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the algorithm of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key type is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation returns the \fI\%Amazon Resource Name (ARN)\fP of the imported certificate.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

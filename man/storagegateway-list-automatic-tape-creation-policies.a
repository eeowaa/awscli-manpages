.SH NAME
storagegateway-list-automatic-tape-creation-policies \- Lists the automatic tape creation policies for a gateway
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists the automatic tape creation policies for a gateway. If there are no automatic tape creation policies for the gateway, it returns an empty list.
.sp
This operation is only supported for tape gateways.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-gateway\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways operation to return a list of gateways for your account and AWS Region.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
AutomaticTapeCreationPolicyInfos \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Gets a listing of information about the gateway\(aqs automatic tape creation policies, including the automatic tape creation rules and the gateway that is using the policies.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Information about the gateway\(aqs automatic tape creation policies, including the automatic tape creation rules and the gateway that is using the policies.
.sp
AutomaticTapeCreationRules \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An automatic tape creation policy consists of a list of automatic tape creation rules. This returns the rules that determine when and how to automatically create new tapes.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An automatic tape creation policy consists of automatic tape creation rules where each rule defines when and how to create new tapes. For more information about automatic tape creation, see \fI\%Creating Tapes Automatically\fP .
.sp
TapeBarcodePrefix \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A prefix that you append to the barcode of the virtual tape that you are creating. This prefix makes the barcode unique.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The prefix must be 1\-4 characters in length and must be one of the uppercase letters from A to Z.

.sp
PoolId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for archiving. The tape in this pool is archived in the Amazon S3 storage class that is associated with the pool. When you use your backup application to eject the tape, the tape is archived directly into the storage class (S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.
.sp
Valid Values: \fBGLACIER\fP | \fBDEEP_ARCHIVE\fP
.UNINDENT

.sp
TapeSizeInBytes \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size, in bytes, of the virtual tape capacity.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MinimumNumTapes \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The minimum number of available virtual tapes that the gateway maintains at all times. If the number of tapes on the gateway goes below this value, the gateway creates as many new tapes as are needed to have \fBMinimumNumTapes\fP on the gateway. For more information about automatic tape creation, see \fI\%Creating Tapes Automatically\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
Worm \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Set to \fBtrue\fP to indicate that tapes are to be archived as write\-once\-read\-many (WORM). Set to \fBfalse\fP when WORM is not enabled for tapes.

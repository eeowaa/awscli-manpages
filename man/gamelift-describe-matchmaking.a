.SH NAME
gamelift-describe-matchmaking \- Retrieves one or more matchmaking tickets
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves one or more matchmaking tickets. Use this operation to retrieve ticket information, including\-\-after a successful match is made\-\-connection information for the resulting new game session.
.sp
To request matchmaking tickets, provide a list of up to 10 ticket IDs. If the request is successful, a ticket object is returned for each requested ID that currently exists.
.sp
This operation is not designed to be continually called to track matchmaking ticket status. This practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors. Instead, as a best practice, set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration. Continuously poling ticket status with  DescribeMatchmaking should only be used for games in development with low matchmaking usage.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

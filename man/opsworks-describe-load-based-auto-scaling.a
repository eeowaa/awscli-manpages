\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo describe a layer\(aqs load\-based scaling configuration\fP
.sp
The following example describes a specified layer\(aqs load\-based scaling configuration.
The layer is identified by its layer ID, which you can find on the layer\(aqs
details page or by running \fBdescribe\-layers\fP\&.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
LoadBasedAutoScalingConfigurations \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of \fBLoadBasedAutoScalingConfiguration\fP objects that describe each layer\(aqs configuration.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Describes a layer\(aqs load\-based auto scaling configuration.
.sp
LayerId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The layer ID.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Enable \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Whether load\-based auto scaling is enabled for the layer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
UpScaling \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An \fBAutoScalingThresholds\fP object that describes the upscaling configuration, which defines how and when AWS OpsWorks Stacks increases the number of instances.
.sp
InstanceCount \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of instances to add or remove when the load exceeds a threshold.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ThresholdsWaitTime \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The amount of time, in minutes, that the load must exceed a threshold before more instances are added or removed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
IgnoreMetricsTime \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The amount of time (in minutes) after a scaling event occurs that AWS OpsWorks Stacks should ignore metrics and suppress additional scaling events. For example, AWS OpsWorks Stacks adds new instances following an upscaling event but the instances won\(aqt start reducing the load until they have been booted and configured. There is no point in raising additional scaling events during that operation, which typically takes several minutes. \fBIgnoreMetricsTime\fP allows you to direct AWS OpsWorks Stacks to suppress scaling events long enough to get the new instances online.
.UNINDENT

.sp
CpuThreshold \-> (double)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The CPU utilization threshold, as a percent of the available CPU. A value of \-1 disables the threshold.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MemoryThreshold \-> (double)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The memory utilization threshold, as a percent of the available memory. A value of \-1 disables the threshold.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
LoadThreshold \-> (double)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The load threshold. A value of \-1 disables the threshold. For more information about how load is computed, see \fI\%Load (computing)\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alarms \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Custom Cloudwatch auto scaling alarms, to be used as thresholds. This parameter takes a list of up to five alarm names, which are case sensitive and must be in the same region as the stack.

To use custom alarms, you must update your service role to allow \fBcloudwatch:DescribeAlarms\fP . You can either have AWS OpsWorks Stacks update the role for you when you first use this feature or you can edit the role manually.

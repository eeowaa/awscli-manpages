\fB\-\-command\-id\fP (string)

(Required) The parent command ID of the invocation plugin.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-instance\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
\fB\-\-plugin\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the plugin for which you want detailed results. If the document contains only one plugin, you can omit the name and details for that plugin. If the document contains more than one plugin, you must specify the name of the plugin for which you want to view details.
.sp
Plugin names are also referred to as \fIstep names\fP in Systems Manager documents. For example, \fBaws:RunShellScript\fP is a plugin.
.sp
To find the \fBPluginName\fP , check the document content and find the name of the plugin. Alternatively, use  ListCommandInvocations with the \fBCommandId\fP and \fBDetails\fP parameters. The \fBPluginName\fP is the \fBName\fP attribute of the \fBCommandPlugin\fP object in the \fBCommandPlugins\fP list.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

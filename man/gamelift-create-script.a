.SH NAME
gamelift-create-script \- Creates a new script record for your Realtime Servers script
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new script record for your Realtime Servers script. Realtime scripts are JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when you create a Realtime Servers fleet to host your game sessions. Script logic is executed during an active game session.
.sp
To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the script file(s). The script files and all dependencies must be zipped into a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these locations:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A locally available directory. Use the \fIZipFile\fP parameter for this option.
.IP \(bu 2
An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your AWS account. Use the \fIStorageLocation\fP parameter for this option. You\(aqll need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows the Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique script ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is uploaded to an Amazon GameLift\-owned S3 bucket and the script record\(aqs storage location reflects this location. If the script file is provided as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift accesses the file at this storage location as needed for deployment.

.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do not need to be unique. You can use  UpdateScript to change this value later.

.sp
\fB\-\-storage\-location\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the \fBObjectVersion\fP parameter to specify an earlier version.
.sp
Bucket \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. This is the name of the S3 bucket.

ObjectVersion \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The version of the file, if object versioning is turned on for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter to specify a specific version of the file. If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.

\fB\-\-zip\-file\fP (blob)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB.
.sp
When using the AWS CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example: \fB\-\-zip\-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip\fP .

\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of labels to assign to the new script resource. Tags are developer\-defined key\-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see \fI\%Tagging AWS Resources\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP . Once the resource is created, you can use  TagResource ,  UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-scope\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API.
.sp
To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
CLI \- Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: \fB\-\-scope=CLOUDFRONT \-\-region=us\-east\-1\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
API and SDKs \- For all calls, use the Region endpoint us\-east\-1.

\fB\-\-web\-acl\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the Web ACL. You cannot change the name of a Web ACL after you create it.

.sp
\fB\-\-web\-acl\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the Web ACL. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.

.sp
\fB\-\-rule\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the rate\-based rule to get the keys for.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

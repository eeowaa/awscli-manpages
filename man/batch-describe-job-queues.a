.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes one or more of your job queues.
.sp

\fBdescribe\-job\-queues\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBjobQueues\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
jobQueues \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of job queues.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An object representing the details of an AWS Batch job queue.
.sp
jobQueueName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the job queue.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
jobQueueArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
state \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Describes the ability of the queue to accept new jobs. If the job queue state is \fBENABLED\fP , it\(aqs able to accept jobs. If the job queue state is \fBDISABLED\fP , new jobs can\(aqt be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the job queue (for example, \fBCREATING\fP or \fBVALID\fP ).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
statusReason \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A short, human\-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the job queue.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
priority \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the \fBpriority\fP parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of \fB10\fP is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of \fB1\fP . All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (\fBEC2\fP or \fBSPOT\fP ) or Fargate (\fBFARGATE\fP or \fBFARGATE_SPOT\fP ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can\(aqt be mixed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
computeEnvironmentOrder \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The compute environments that are attached to the job queue and the order that job placement is preferred. Compute environments are selected for job placement in ascending order.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The order in which compute environments are tried for job placement within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the \fBVALID\fP state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (\fBEC2\fP or \fBSPOT\fP ) or Fargate (\fBFARGATE\fP or \fBFARGATE_SPOT\fP ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can\(aqt be mixed.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. AWS Batch doesn\(aqt support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
order \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The order of the compute environment. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower \fBorder\fP integer value is tried for job placement first.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
computeEnvironment \-> (string)

The \fBnextToken\fP value to include in a future \fBDescribeJobQueues\fP request. When the results of a \fBDescribeJobQueues\fP request exceed \fBmaxResults\fP , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is \fBnull\fP when there are no more results to return.

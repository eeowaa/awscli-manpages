.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-container\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name for the container. The name must be from 1 to 255 characters. Container names must be unique to your AWS account within a specific region. As an example, you could create a container named \fBmovies\fP in every region, as long as you donâ€™t have an existing container with that name.

.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of key:value pairs that you define. These values can be anything that you want. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each container. For more information about tagging, including naming and usage conventions, see \fI\%Tagging Resources in MediaStore\fP .
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A collection of tags associated with a container. Each tag consists of a key:value pair, which can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each container. For more information about tagging, including naming and usage conventions, see \fI\%Tagging Resources in MediaStore\fP .
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case\-sensitive.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case\-sensitive.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Container \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
ContainerARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the newly created container. The ARN has the following format: arn:aws:<region>:<account that owns this container>:container/<name of container>. For example: arn:aws:mediastore:us\-west\-2:111122223333:container/movies
.sp
ContainerName: The container name as specified in the request.
.sp
CreationTime: Unix time stamp.
.sp
Status: The status of container creation or deletion. The status is one of the following: \fBCREATING\fP , \fBACTIVE\fP , or \fBDELETING\fP . While the service is creating the container, the status is \fBCREATING\fP . When an endpoint is available, the status changes to \fBACTIVE\fP .
.sp
The return value does not include the container\(aqs endpoint. To make downstream requests, you must obtain this value by using  DescribeContainer or  ListContainers .
.sp
Endpoint \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The DNS endpoint of the container. Use the endpoint to identify the specific container when sending requests to the data plane. The service assigns this value when the container is created. Once the value has been assigned, it does not change.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CreationTime \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Unix timestamp.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ARN \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container. The ARN has the following format:
.sp
arn:aws:<region>:<account that owns this container>:container/<name of container>
.sp
For example: arn:aws:mediastore:us\-west\-2:111122223333:container/movies
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the container.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of container creation or deletion. The status is one of the following: \fBCREATING\fP , \fBACTIVE\fP , or \fBDELETING\fP . While the service is creating the container, the status is \fBCREATING\fP . When the endpoint is available, the status changes to \fBACTIVE\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AccessLoggingEnabled \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The state of access logging on the container. This value is \fBfalse\fP by default, indicating that AWS Elemental MediaStore does not send access logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. When you enable access logging on the container, MediaStore changes this value to \fBtrue\fP , indicating that the service delivers access logs for objects stored in that container to CloudWatch Logs.

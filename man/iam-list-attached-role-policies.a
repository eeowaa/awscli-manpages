.SH NAME
iam-list-attached-role-policies \- Lists all managed policies that are attached to the specified IAM role
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists all managed policies that are attached to the specified IAM role.
.sp
An IAM role can also have inline policies embedded with it. To list the inline policies for a role, use  ListRolePolicies . For information about policies, see \fI\%Managed policies and inline policies\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
You can paginate the results using the \fBMaxItems\fP and \fBMarker\fP parameters. You can use the \fBPathPrefix\fP parameter to limit the list of policies to only those matching the specified path prefix. If there are no policies attached to the specified role (or none that match the specified path prefix), the operation returns an empty list.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBlist\-attached\-role\-policies\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBAttachedPolicies\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-role\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the role to list attached policies for.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-path\-prefix\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\fB\eu0021\fP ) through the DEL character (\fB\eu007F\fP ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
AttachedPolicies \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of the attached policies.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains information about an attached policy.
.sp
An attached policy is a managed policy that has been attached to a user, group, or role. This data type is used as a response element in the  ListAttachedGroupPolicies ,  ListAttachedRolePolicies ,  ListAttachedUserPolicies , and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations.
.sp
For more information about managed policies, refer to \fI\%Managed policies and inline policies\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
PolicyName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The friendly name of the attached policy.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PolicyArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identifiers for AWS resources.
.sp
For more information about ARNs, go to \fI\%Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP .

IsTruncated \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the \fBMarker\fP request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the \fBMaxItems\fP number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check \fBIsTruncated\fP after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Marker \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When \fBIsTruncated\fP is \fBtrue\fP , this element is present and contains the value to use for the \fBMarker\fP parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

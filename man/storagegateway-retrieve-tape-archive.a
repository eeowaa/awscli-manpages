.SH NAME
storagegateway-retrieve-tape-archive \- Retrieves an archived virtual tape from the virtual tape shelf (VTS) to a tape gateway
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves an archived virtual tape from the virtual tape shelf (VTS) to a tape gateway. Virtual tapes archived in the VTS are not associated with any gateway. However after a tape is retrieved, it is associated with a gateway, even though it is also listed in the VTS, that is, archive. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.
.sp
Once a tape is successfully retrieved to a gateway, it cannot be retrieved again to another gateway. You must archive the tape again before you can retrieve it to another gateway. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

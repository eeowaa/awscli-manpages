.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket with each request. You can use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. A \fB200 OK\fP response can contain valid or invalid XML. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. Objects are returned sorted in an ascending order of the respective key names in the list. For more information about listing objects, see \fI\%Listing object keys programmatically\fP
.sp
To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.
.sp
To use this action in an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, you must have permissions to perform the \fBs3:ListBucket\fP action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see \fI\%Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations\fP and \fI\%Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources\fP .
.sp

\fBlist\-objects\-v2\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBContents\fP, \fBCommonPrefixes\fP

\fB\-\-bucket\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Bucket name to list.
.sp
When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .s3\-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \fI\%Using access points\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .*outpostID* .s3\-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \fI\%Using S3 on Outposts\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-fetch\-owner\fP | \fB\-\-no\-fetch\-owner\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-start\-after\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
StartAfter is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon S3 starts listing after this specified key. StartAfter can be any key in the bucket.

.sp
\fB\-\-request\-payer\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the list objects request in V2 style. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-expected\-bucket\-owner\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

ETag \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only to the contents of an object, not its metadata. The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data. Whether or not it is depends on how the object was created and how it is encrypted as described below:
.INDENT 0.0

Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the AWS Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE\-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data.
.IP \(bu 2
Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the AWS Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE\-C or SSE\-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5 digest of their object data.

Delimiter \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the CommonPrefixes collection. These rolled\-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each rolled\-up result counts as only one return against the \fBMaxKeys\fP value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

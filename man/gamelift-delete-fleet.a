.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes all resources and information related a fleet. Any current fleet instances, including those in remote locations, are shut down. You don\(aqt need to call \fBDeleteFleetLocations\fP separately.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization . You do not need to explicitly delete the VPC peering connection\-\-this is done as part of the delete fleet process.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To delete a fleet, specify the fleet ID to be terminated. During the deletion process the fleet status is changed to \fBDELETING\fP . When completed, the status switches to \fBTERMINATED\fP and the fleet event \fBFLEET_DELETED\fP is sent.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-fleet\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the fleet to be deleted. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo delete a fleet that is no longer in use\fP
.sp
The following \fBdelete\-fleet\fP example removes a fleet that has been scaled down to zero instances. If the fleet capacity is greater than zero, the request fails with an HTTP 400 error.

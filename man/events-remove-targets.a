events-remove-targets \- Removes the specified targets from the specified rule
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Removes the specified targets from the specified rule. When the rule is triggered, those targets are no longer be invoked.
.sp
When you remove a target, when the associated rule triggers, removed targets might continue to be invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
.sp
This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, \fBFailedEntryCount\fP is non\-zero in the response and each entry in \fBFailedEntries\fP provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.

If this is a managed rule, created by an AWS service on your behalf, you must specify \fBForce\fP as \fBTrue\fP to remove targets. This parameter is ignored for rules that are not managed rules. You can check whether a rule is a managed rule by using \fBDescribeRule\fP or \fBListRules\fP and checking the \fBManagedBy\fP field of the response.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

route53-update-traffic-policy-instance \- Updates the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone that were created based on the settings in a specified traffic policy version
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone that were created based on the settings in a specified traffic policy version.
.sp
When you update a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 continues to respond to DNS queries for the root resource record set name (such as example.com) while it replaces one group of resource record sets with another. Route 53 performs the following operations:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Route 53 creates a new group of resource record sets based on the specified traffic policy. This is true regardless of how significant the differences are between the existing resource record sets and the new resource record sets.
.IP \(bu 2
When all of the new resource record sets have been created, Route 53 starts to respond to DNS queries for the root resource record set name (such as example.com) by using the new resource record sets.
.IP \(bu 2
Route 53 deletes the old group of resource record sets that are associated with the root resource record set name.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

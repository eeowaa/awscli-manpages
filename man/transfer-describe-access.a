\fB\-\-server\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A system\-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this access assigned.

.sp
\fB\-\-external\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within your directory. The users of the group you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using AWS Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBGet\-ADGroup \-Filter {samAccountName \-like "*YourGroupName* *"} \-Properties * | Select SamaccountName,ObjectSid\fP
.UNINDENT

.sp
In that command, replace \fIYourGroupName\fP with the name of your Active Directory group.
.sp
The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/\-

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
ServerId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A system\-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this access assigned.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Access \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The external ID of the server that the access is attached to.
.sp
HomeDirectory \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the landing directory (or folder), which is the location that files are written to or read from in an Amazon S3 bucket, for the described access.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HomeDirectoryMappings \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to the associated access and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the "\fBEntry\fP " and "\fBTarget\fP " pair, where \fBEntry\fP shows how the path is made visible and \fBTarget\fP is the actual Amazon S3 or EFS path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You also must ensure that your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in \fBTarget\fP .
.sp
In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope\-down policy to lock down the associated access to the designated home directory ("\fBchroot\fP "). To do this, you can set \fBEntry\fP to \(aq/\(aq and set \fBTarget\fP to the \fBHomeDirectory\fP parameter value.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents an object that contains entries and targets for \fBHomeDirectoryMappings\fP .
.sp
Entry \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents an entry and a target for \fBHomeDirectoryMappings\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
Target \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

HomeDirectoryType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users\(aq home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to \fBPATH\fP , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to \fBLOGICAL\fP , you must provide mappings in the \fBHomeDirectoryMappings\fP for how you want to make Amazon S3 paths visible to your users.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Policy \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A scope\-down policy for your user so that you can use the same AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include \fB${Transfer:UserName}\fP , \fB${Transfer:HomeDirectory}\fP , and \fB${Transfer:HomeBucket}\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PosixProfile \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The full POSIX identity, including user ID (\fBUid\fP ), group ID (\fBGid\fP ), and any secondary groups IDs (\fBSecondaryGids\fP ), that controls your users\(aq access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.
.sp
Uid \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Gid \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SecondaryGids \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Role \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The IAM role that controls access to your Amazon S3 bucket from the specified associated access. The policies attached to this role will determine the level of access that you want to provide the associated access when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or buckets. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows a server to access your resources when servicing transfer requests for the associated access.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ExternalId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. Think of the \fBExternalID\fP as a group membership mechanism that uses a unique identifier (often a SID, but could be a group name or something else) as a basis. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the \fBExternalId\fP parameter. A cross\-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account.

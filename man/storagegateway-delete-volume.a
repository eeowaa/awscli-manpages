.SH NAME
storagegateway-delete-volume \- Deletes the specified storage volume that you previously created using the  CreateCachediSCSIVolume or  CreateStorediSCSIVolume API
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified storage volume that you previously created using the  CreateCachediSCSIVolume or  CreateStorediSCSIVolume API. This operation is only supported in the cached volume and stored volume types. For stored volume gateways, the local disk that was configured as the storage volume is not deleted. You can reuse the local disk to create another storage volume.
.sp
Before you delete a volume, make sure there are no iSCSI connections to the volume you are deleting. You should also make sure there is no snapshot in progress. You can use the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) API to query snapshots on the volume you are deleting and check the snapshot status. For more information, go to \fI\%DescribeSnapshots\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference\fP .
.sp
In the request, you must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage volume you want to delete.

.SH OPTIONS

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume. Use the  ListVolumes operation to return a list of gateway volumes.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

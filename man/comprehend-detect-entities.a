.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-text\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A UTF\-8 text string. Each string must contain fewer that 5,000 bytes of UTF\-8 encoded characters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-language\-code\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the primary languages supported by Amazon Comprehend. All documents must be in the same language.
.sp
If your request includes the endpoint for a custom entity recognition model, Amazon Comprehend uses the language of your custom model, and it ignores any language code that you specify here.
.sp

\fB\-\-endpoint\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name of an endpoint that is associated with a custom entity recognition model. Provide an endpoint if you want to detect entities by using your own custom model instead of the default model that is used by Amazon Comprehend.
.sp
If you specify an endpoint, Amazon Comprehend uses the language of your custom model, and it ignores any language code that you provide in your request.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Entities \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A collection of entities identified in the input text. For each entity, the response provides the entity text, entity type, where the entity text begins and ends, and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the detection.
.sp
If your request uses a custom entity recognition model, Amazon Comprehend detects the entities that the model is trained to recognize. Otherwise, it detects the default entity types. For a list of default entity types, see  how\-entities .
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Provides information about an entity.
.sp
Score \-> (float)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the detection.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Type \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The entity\(aqs type.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Text \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The text of the entity.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
BeginOffset \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A character offset in the input text that shows where the entity begins (the first character is at position 0). The offset returns the position of each UTF\-8 code point in the string. A \fIcode point\fP is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi\-byte UTF\-8 character maps to a single code point.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EndOffset \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A character offset in the input text that shows where the entity ends. The offset returns the position of each UTF\-8 code point in the string. A \fIcode point\fP is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi\-byte UTF\-8 character maps to a single code point.

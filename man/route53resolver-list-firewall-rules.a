.SH NAME
route53resolver-list-firewall-rules \- Retrieves the firewall rules that you have defined for the specified firewall rule group
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the firewall rules that you have defined for the specified firewall rule group. DNS Firewall uses the rules in a rule group to filter DNS network traffic for a VPC.
.sp
A single call might return only a partial list of the rules. For information, see \fBMaxResults\fP .
.sp

See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

\fBlist\-firewall\-rules\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBFirewallRules\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-rule\-group\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier of the firewall rule group that you want to retrieve the rules for.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-priority\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional additional filter for the rules to retrieve.
.sp
The setting that determines the processing order of the rules in a rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules in a rule group by order of priority, starting from the lowest setting.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-action\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional additional filter for the rules to retrieve.
.sp
The action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when it matches one of the domains in the rule\(aqs domain list:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBALLOW\fP \- Permit the request to go through.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBALERT\fP \- Permit the request to go through but send an alert to the logs.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBLOCK\fP \- Disallow the request. If this is specified, additional handling details are provided in the rule\(aqs \fBBlockResponse\fP setting.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

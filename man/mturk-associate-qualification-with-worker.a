.SH NAME
mturk-associate-qualification-with-worker \- The AssociateQualificationWithWorker operation gives a Worker a Qualification
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBAssociateQualificationWithWorker\fP operation gives a Worker a Qualification. \fBAssociateQualificationWithWorker\fP does not require that the Worker submit a Qualification request. It gives the Qualification directly to the Worker.
.sp
You can only assign a Qualification of a Qualification type that you created (using the \fBCreateQualificationType\fP operation).
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Note: \fBAssociateQualificationWithWorker\fP does not affect any pending Qualification requests for the Qualification by the Worker. If you assign a Qualification to a Worker, then later grant a Qualification request made by the Worker, the granting of the request may modify the Qualification score. To resolve a pending Qualification request without affecting the Qualification the Worker already has, reject the request with the \fBRejectQualificationRequest\fP operation.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
sagemaker-add-association \- Creates an association between the source and the destination
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an \fIassociation\fP between the source and the destination. A source can be associated with multiple destinations, and a destination can be associated with multiple sources. An association is a lineage tracking entity. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking\fP .

\fB\-\-association\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of association. The following are suggested uses for each type. Amazon SageMaker places no restrictions on their use.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ContributedTo \- The source contributed to the destination or had a part in enabling the destination. For example, the training data contributed to the training job.
.IP \(bu 2
AssociatedWith \- The source is connected to the destination. For example, an approval workflow is associated with a model deployment.
.IP \(bu 2
DerivedFrom \- The destination is a modification of the source. For example, a digest output of a channel input for a processing job is derived from the original inputs.
.IP \(bu 2
Produced \- The source generated the destination. For example, a training job produced a model artifact.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

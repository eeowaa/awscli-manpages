.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Claims an AWS CloudHSM cluster by submitting the cluster certificate issued by your issuing certificate authority (CA) and the CA\(aqs root certificate. Before you can claim a cluster, you must sign the cluster\(aqs certificate signing request (CSR) with your issuing CA. To get the cluster\(aqs CSR, use  DescribeClusters .

.sp
\fB\-\-cluster\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier (ID) of the cluster that you are claiming. To find the cluster ID, use  DescribeClusters .

.sp
\fB\-\-signed\-cert\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The cluster certificate issued (signed) by your issuing certificate authority (CA). The certificate must be in PEM format and can contain a maximum of 5000 characters.

.sp
\fB\-\-trust\-anchor\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The issuing certificate of the issuing certificate authority (CA) that issued (signed) the cluster certificate. You must use a self\-signed certificate. The certificate used to sign the HSM CSR must be directly available, and thus must be the root certificate. The certificate must be in PEM format and can contain a maximum of 5000 characters.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

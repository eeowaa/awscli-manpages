\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo delete an instance\fP
.sp
The following \fBdelete\-instance\fP example deletes a specified instance, which is identified by its instance ID. You can find an instance ID by opening the instance\(aqs details page in the AWS OpsWorks console, or by
running the \fBdescribe\-instances\fP command.
.sp
If the instance is online, you must first stop the instance by calling \fBstop\-instance\fP, and then you must wait until the instance has stopped. Run \fBdescribe\-instances\fP to check the instance status.
.sp
To remove the instance\(aqs Amazon EBS volumes or Elastic IP addresses, add the \fB\-\-delete\-volumes\fP or \fB\-\-delete\-elastic\-ip\fP arguments, respectively.:

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Enables server\-side encryption (SSE) for the delivery stream.
.sp
This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke it, Kinesis Data Firehose first sets the encryption status of the stream to \fBENABLING\fP , and then to \fBENABLED\fP . The encryption status of a delivery stream is the \fBStatus\fP property in  DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfiguration . If the operation fails, the encryption status changes to \fBENABLING_FAILED\fP . You can continue to read and write data to your delivery stream while the encryption status is \fBENABLING\fP , but the data is not encrypted. It can take up to 5 seconds after the encryption status changes to \fBENABLED\fP before all records written to the delivery stream are encrypted. To find out whether a record or a batch of records was encrypted, check the response elements  PutRecordOutput$Encrypted and  PutRecordBatchOutput$Encrypted , respectively.
.sp
To check the encryption status of a delivery stream, use  DescribeDeliveryStream .
.sp
Even if encryption is currently enabled for a delivery stream, you can still invoke this operation on it to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN. If you invoke this method to change the CMK, and the old CMK is of type \fBCUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK\fP , Kinesis Data Firehose schedules the grant it had on the old CMK for retirement. If the new CMK is of type \fBCUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK\fP , Kinesis Data Firehose creates a grant that enables it to use the new CMK to encrypt and decrypt data and to manage the grant.
.sp
If a delivery stream already has encryption enabled and then you invoke this operation to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN and you get \fBENABLING_FAILED\fP , this only means that the attempt to change the CMK failed. In this case, encryption remains enabled with the old CMK.
.sp
If the encryption status of your delivery stream is \fBENABLING_FAILED\fP , you can invoke this operation again with a valid CMK. The CMK must be enabled and the key policy mustn\(aqt explicitly deny the permission for Kinesis Data Firehose to invoke KMS encrypt and decrypt operations.
.sp
You can enable SSE for a delivery stream only if it\(aqs a delivery stream that uses \fBDirectPut\fP as its source.
.sp
The \fBStartDeliveryStreamEncryption\fP and \fBStopDeliveryStreamEncryption\fP operations have a combined limit of 25 calls per delivery stream per 24 hours. For example, you reach the limit if you call \fBStartDeliveryStreamEncryption\fP 13 times and \fBStopDeliveryStreamEncryption\fP 12 times for the same delivery stream in a 24\-hour period.

.INDENT 3.5
The name of the delivery stream for which you want to enable server\-side encryption (SSE).

\fB\-\-delivery\-stream\-encryption\-configuration\-input\fP (structure)

.INDENT 3.5
If you set \fBKeyType\fP to \fBCUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK\fP , you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK. If you set \fBKeyType\fP to \fBAWS_OWNED_CMK\fP , Kinesis Data Firehose uses a service\-account CMK.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
KeyType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates the type of customer master key (CMK) to use for encryption. The default setting is \fBAWS_OWNED_CMK\fP . For more information about CMKs, see \fI\%Customer Master Keys (CMKs)\fP . When you invoke  CreateDeliveryStream or  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption with \fBKeyType\fP set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK, Kinesis Data Firehose invokes the Amazon KMS operation \fI\%CreateGrant\fP to create a grant that allows the Kinesis Data Firehose service to use the customer managed CMK to perform encryption and decryption. Kinesis Data Firehose manages that grant.
.sp
When you invoke  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption to change the CMK for a delivery stream that is encrypted with a customer managed CMK, Kinesis Data Firehose schedules the grant it had on the old CMK for retirement.
.sp
You can use a CMK of type CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK to encrypt up to 500 delivery streams. If a  CreateDeliveryStream or  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption operation exceeds this limit, Kinesis Data Firehose throws a \fBLimitExceededException\fP .
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
To encrypt your delivery stream, use symmetric CMKs. Kinesis Data Firehose doesn\(aqt support asymmetric CMKs. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see \fI\%About Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs\fP in the AWS Key Management Service developer guide.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

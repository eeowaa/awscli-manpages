.SH NAME
route53resolver-delete-resolver-rule \- Deletes a Resolver rule
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a Resolver rule. Before you can delete a Resolver rule, you must disassociate it from all the VPCs that you associated the Resolver rule with. For more information, see \fI\%DisassociateResolverRule\fP .
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo delete a Resolver rule\fP
.sp
The following \fBdelete\-resolver\-rule\fP example deletes the specified rule.
.sp
\fBNote\fP If a rule is associated with any VPCs, you must first disassociate the rule from the VPCs before you can delete it.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
ResolverRule \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Information about the \fBDeleteResolverRule\fP request, including the status of the request.
.sp
Id \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you created it.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CreatorRequestId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique string that you specified when you created the Resolver rule. \fBCreatorRequestId\fP identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Arn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver rule specified by \fBId\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
DomainName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
DNS queries for this domain name are forwarded to the IP addresses that are specified in \fBTargetIps\fP . If a query matches multiple Resolver rules (example.com and www.example.com), the query is routed using the Resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver rule.
.UNINDENT

.sp
RuleType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name to resolvers on your network, specify \fBFORWARD\fP .
.sp
When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a domain to your network and you want Resolver to process queries for a subdomain of that domain, specify \fBSYSTEM\fP .
.sp
For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers on your network, you create a rule and specify \fBFORWARD\fP for \fBRuleType\fP . To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you create a rule and specify \fBSYSTEM\fP for \fBRuleType\fP .
.sp
Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a value of \fBRECURSIVE\fP for \fBRuleType\fP .

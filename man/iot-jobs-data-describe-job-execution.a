.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-job\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier assigned to this job when it was created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-thing\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The thing name associated with the device the job execution is running on.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-include\-job\-document\fP | \fB\-\-no\-include\-job\-document\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional. When set to true, the response contains the job document. The default is false.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-execution\-number\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional. A number that identifies a particular job execution on a particular device. If not specified, the latest job execution is returned.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

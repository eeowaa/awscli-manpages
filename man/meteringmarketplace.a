Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren\(aqt required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see \fI\%Container\-Based Products\fP .

BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the * \fI\%AWS CloudTrail User Guide\fP * .

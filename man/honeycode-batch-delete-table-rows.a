.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-workbook\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the workbook where the rows are being deleted.
.sp
If a workbook with the specified id could not be found, this API throws ResourceNotFoundException.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-table\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the table where the rows are being deleted.
.sp
If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws ResourceNotFoundException.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-row\-ids\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of row ids to delete from the table. You need to specify at least one row id in this list.
.sp
Note that if one of the row ids provided in the request does not exist in the table, then the request fails and no rows are deleted from the table.

\fB\-\-client\-request\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The request token for performing the delete action. Request tokens help to identify duplicate requests. If a call times out or fails due to a transient error like a failed network connection, you can retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that if the first call using that request token is successfully performed, the second call will not perform the action again.
.sp
Note that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You cannot use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

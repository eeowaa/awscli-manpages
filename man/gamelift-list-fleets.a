.SH NAME
gamelift-list-fleets \- Retrieves a collection of fleet resources in an AWS Region
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves a collection of fleet resources in an AWS Region. You can call this operation to get fleets in a previously selected default Region (see \fI\%https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting\-global\-region.html\fP or specify a Region in your request. You can filter the result set to find only those fleets that are deployed with a specific build or script. For fleets that have multiple locations, this operation retrieves fleets based on their home Region only.
.sp
This operation can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To get a list of all fleets in a Region, don\(aqt provide a build or script identifier.
.IP \(bu 2
To get a list of all fleets where a specific custom game build is deployed, provide the build ID.
.IP \(bu 2
To get a list of all Realtime Servers fleets with a specific configuration script, provide the script ID.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
.sp
If successful, a list of fleet IDs that match the request parameters is returned. A NextToken value is also returned if there are more result pages to retrieve.

\fBlist\-fleets\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBFleetIds\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-build\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the build to request fleets for. Use this parameter to return only fleets using a specified build. Use either the build ID or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-script\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the Realtime script to request fleets for. Use this parameter to return only fleets using a specified script. Use either the script ID or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBExample1: To get a list of all fleets in a Region\fP
.sp
The following \fBlist\-fleets\fP example displays the fleet IDs of all fleets in the current Region. This example uses pagination parameters to retrieve two fleet IDs at a time. The response includes a \fBnext\-token\fP attribute, which indicates that there are more results to retrieve.

\fBExample2: To get a list of all fleets in a Region with a specific build or script\fP
.sp
The following \fBlist\-builds\fP example retrieves the IDs of fleets that are deployed with the specified game build. If you\(aqre working with Realtime Servers, you can provide a script ID in place of a build ID. Because this example does not specify the limit parameter, the results can include up to 16 fleet IDs.

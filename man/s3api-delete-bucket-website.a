.SH NAME
s3api-delete-bucket-website \- This action removes the website configuration for a bucket
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a \fB200 OK\fP response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a \fB200 OK\fP response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a \fB404\fP response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.
.sp
This DELETE action requires the \fBS3:DeleteBucketWebsite\fP permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the \fBS3:DeleteBucketWebsite\fP permission.
.sp
For more information about hosting websites, see \fI\%Hosting Websites on Amazon S3\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

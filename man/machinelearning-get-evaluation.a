.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-evaluation\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the \fBEvaluation\fP to retrieve. The evaluation of each \fBMLModel\fP is recorded and cataloged. The ID provides the means to access the information.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

PerformanceMetrics \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Measurements of how well the \fBMLModel\fP performed using observations referenced by the \fBDataSource\fP . One of the following metric is returned based on the type of the \fBMLModel\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
BinaryAUC: A binary \fBMLModel\fP uses the Area Under the Curve (AUC) technique to measure performance.
.IP \(bu 2
RegressionRMSE: A regression \fBMLModel\fP uses the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) technique to measure performance. RMSE measures the difference between predicted and actual values for a single variable.
.IP \(bu 2
MulticlassAvgFScore: A multiclass \fBMLModel\fP uses the F1 score technique to measure performance.

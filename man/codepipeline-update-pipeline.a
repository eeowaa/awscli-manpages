\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo update the structure of a pipeline\fP
.sp
This example uses the update\-pipeline command with the \-\-cli\-input\-json argument. This example uses a pre\-defined JSON file (MyFirstPipeline.json) to update the structure of a pipeline. AWS CodePipeline recognizes the pipeline name contained in the JSON file, and then applies any changes from modified fields in the pipeline structure to update the pipeline.
.sp
Use the following guidelines when creating the pre\-defined JSON file:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you are working with a pipeline structure retrieved using the get\-pipeline command, you must remove the metadata section from the pipeline structure in the JSON file (the "metadata": { } lines and the "created," "pipelineARN," and "updated" fields within).
.IP \(bu 2
The pipeline name cannot be changed.

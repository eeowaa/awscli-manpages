\fBget\-organization\-config\-rule\-detailed\-status\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBOrganizationConfigRuleDetailedStatus\fP

.sp
MemberAccountRuleStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates deployment status for config rule in the member account. When master account calls \fBPutOrganizationConfigRule\fP action for the first time, config rule status is created in the member account. When master account calls \fBPutOrganizationConfigRule\fP action for the second time, config rule status is updated in the member account. Config rule status is deleted when the master account deletes \fBOrganizationConfigRule\fP and disables service access for \fBconfig\-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com\fP .
.sp
AWS Config sets the state of the rule to:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATE_SUCCESSFUL\fP when config rule has been created in the member account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATE_IN_PROGRESS\fP when config rule is being created in the member account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATE_FAILED\fP when config rule creation has failed in the member account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETE_FAILED\fP when config rule deletion has failed in the member account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETE_IN_PROGRESS\fP when config rule is being deleted in the member account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETE_SUCCESSFUL\fP when config rule has been deleted in the member account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUPDATE_SUCCESSFUL\fP when config rule has been updated in the member account.
.IP \(bu 2

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

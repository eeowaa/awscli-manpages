.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Stops an Amazon EBS\-backed instance.
.sp
You can use the Stop action to hibernate an instance if the instance is \fI\%enabled for hibernation\fP and it meets the \fI\%hibernation prerequisites\fP . For more information, see \fI\%Hibernate your instance\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 User Guide\fP .
.sp
We don\(aqt charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60\-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one\-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.
.sp
You can\(aqt stop or hibernate instance store\-backed instances. You can\(aqt use the Stop action to hibernate Spot Instances, but you can specify that Amazon EC2 should hibernate Spot Instances when they are interrupted. For more information, see \fI\%Hibernating interrupted Spot Instances\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 User Guide\fP .
.sp
When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs.
.sp
Stopping and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see \fI\%Instance lifecycle\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 User Guide\fP .
.sp
When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information, see \fI\%Troubleshooting stopping your instance\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 User Guide\fP .

Hibernates the instance if the instance was enabled for hibernation at launch. If the instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs. For more information, see \fI\%Hibernate your instance\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 User Guide\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \fBDryRunOperation\fP . Otherwise, it is \fBUnauthorizedOperation\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-force\fP | \fB\-\-no\-force\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Forces the instances to stop. The instances do not have an opportunity to flush file system caches or file system metadata. If you use this option, you must perform file system check and repair procedures. This option is not recommended for Windows instances.
.sp
Default: \fBfalse\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

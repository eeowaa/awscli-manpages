.SH NAME
gamelift-describe-game-session-details \- Retrieves additional game session properties, including the game session protection policy in force, a set of one or more game sessions in a specific fleet location
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves additional game session properties, including the game session protection policy in force, a set of one or more game sessions in a specific fleet location. You can optionally filter the results by current game session status. Alternatively, use  SearchGameSessions to request a set of active game sessions that are filtered by certain criteria. To retrieve all game session properties, use  DescribeGameSessions .
.sp
This operation can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID, with an optional status filter. This approach returns details from the fleet\(aqs home Region and all remote locations.
.IP \(bu 2
To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, with optional status filter. The location can be the fleet\(aqs home Region or any remote location.
.IP \(bu 2
To retrieve details for a specific game session, provide the game session ID. This approach looks for the game session ID in all fleets that reside in the AWS Region defined in the request.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
.sp
If successful, a \fBGameSessionDetail\fP object is returned for each game session that matches the request.

\fBdescribe\-game\-session\-details\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBGameSessionDetails\fP

A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve all game sessions active on the fleet. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-game\-session\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the game session to retrieve.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-alias\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the alias associated with the fleet to retrieve all game sessions for. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-location\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A fleet location to get game sessions for. You can specify a fleet\(aqs home Region or a remote location. Use the AWS Region code format, such as \fBus\-west\-2\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-status\-filter\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Game session status to filter results on. Possible game session statuses include \fBACTIVE\fP , \fBTERMINATED\fP , \fBACTIVATING\fP and \fBTERMINATING\fP (the last two are transitory).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

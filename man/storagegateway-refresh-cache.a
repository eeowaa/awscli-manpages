.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Refreshes the cached inventory of objects for the specified file share. This operation finds objects in the Amazon S3 bucket that were added, removed, or replaced since the gateway last listed the bucket\(aqs contents and cached the results. This operation does not import files into the file gateway cache storage. It only updates the cached inventory to reflect changes in the inventory of the objects in the S3 bucket. This operation is only supported in the file gateway type. You can subscribe to be notified through an Amazon CloudWatch event when your \fBRefreshCache\fP operation completes. For more information, see \fI\%Getting notified about file operations\fP in the \fIAWS Storage Gateway User Guide\fP .
.sp
When this API is called, it only initiates the refresh operation. When the API call completes and returns a success code, it doesn\(aqt necessarily mean that the file refresh has completed. You should use the refresh\-complete notification to determine that the operation has completed before you check for new files on the gateway file share. You can subscribe to be notified through a CloudWatch event when your \fBRefreshCache\fP operation completes.
.sp
Throttle limit: This API is asynchronous, so the gateway will accept no more than two refreshes at any time. We recommend using the refresh\-complete CloudWatch event notification before issuing additional requests. For more information, see \fI\%Getting notified about file operations\fP in the \fIAWS Storage Gateway User Guide\fP .
.sp
If you invoke the RefreshCache API when two requests are already being processed, any new request will cause an \fBInvalidGatewayRequestException\fP error because too many requests were sent to the server.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Getting notified about file operations\fP in the \fIAWS Storage Gateway User Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-file\-share\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share you want to refresh.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-folder\-list\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A comma\-separated list of the paths of folders to refresh in the cache. The default is [\fB"/"\fP ]. The default refreshes objects and folders at the root of the Amazon S3 bucket. If \fBRecursive\fP is set to \fBtrue\fP , the entire S3 bucket that the file share has access to is refreshed.

\fB\-\-recursive\fP | \fB\-\-no\-recursive\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that specifies whether to recursively refresh folders in the cache. The refresh includes folders that were in the cache the last time the gateway listed the folder\(aqs contents. If this value set to \fBtrue\fP , each folder that is listed in \fBFolderList\fP is recursively updated. Otherwise, subfolders listed in \fBFolderList\fP are not refreshed. Only objects that are in folders listed directly under \fBFolderList\fP are found and used for the update. The default is \fBtrue\fP .

Valid Values: \fBtrue\fP | \fBfalse\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

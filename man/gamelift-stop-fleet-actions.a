.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Suspends certain types of activity in a fleet location. Currently, this operation is used to stop auto\-scaling activity. For multi\-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location.
.sp
Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to temporarily stop auto\-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies for use in the future. For multi\-location fleets, you can set up fleet\-wide auto\-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain locations.
.sp
This operation can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To stop actions on instances in the fleet\(aqs home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend.
.IP \(bu 2
To stop actions on instances in one of the fleet\(aqs remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to suspend.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If successful, GameLift no longer initiates scaling events except in response to manual changes using  UpdateFleetCapacity . You can view a fleet\(aqs stopped actions using  DescribeFleetAttributes or  DescribeFleetLocationAttributes . Suspended activity can be restarted using  StartFleetActions .

.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the fleet to stop actions on. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

\fB\-\-location\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The fleet location to stop fleet actions for. Specify a location in the form of an AWS Region code, such as \fBus\-west\-2\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo stop a fleet\(aqs automatic scaling activity\fP
.sp
The following \fBstop\-fleet\-actions\fP example stops the use of all scaling policies that are defined for the specified fleet. After the policies are suspended, fleet capacity remains at the same active instance count unless you adjust it manually.

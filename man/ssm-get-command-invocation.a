.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-command\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Required) The parent command ID of the invocation plugin.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-instance\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Required) The ID of the managed instance targeted by the command. A managed instance can be an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance or an instance in your hybrid environment that is configured for AWS Systems Manager.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-plugin\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the plugin for which you want detailed results. If the document contains only one plugin, you can omit the name and details for that plugin. If the document contains more than one plugin, you must specify the name of the plugin for which you want to view details.
.sp
Plugin names are also referred to as \fIstep names\fP in Systems Manager documents. For example, \fBaws:RunShellScript\fP is a plugin.
.sp
To find the \fBPluginName\fP , check the document content and find the name of the plugin. Alternatively, use  ListCommandInvocations with the \fBCommandId\fP and \fBDetails\fP parameters. The \fBPluginName\fP is the \fBName\fP attribute of the \fBCommandPlugin\fP object in the \fBCommandPlugins\fP list.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Pending: The command has not been sent to the instance.
.IP \(bu 2
In Progress: The command has been sent to the instance but has not reached a terminal state.
.IP \(bu 2
Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the target, but the target was not available. The instance might not be available because of network issues, because the instance was stopped, or for similar reasons. The system will try to send the command again.
.IP \(bu 2
Success: The command or plugin ran successfully. This is a terminal state.
.IP \(bu 2
Delivery Timed Out: The command was not delivered to the instance before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts do not count against the parent command\(aqs \fBMaxErrors\fP limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
.IP \(bu 2
Execution Timed Out: The command started to run on the instance, but the execution was not complete before the timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the \fBMaxErrors\fP limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
.IP \(bu 2
Failed: The command wasn\(aqt run successfully on the instance. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code was not zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins was not zero. Invocation failures count against the \fBMaxErrors\fP limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
.IP \(bu 2
Canceled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.
.IP \(bu 2
Undeliverable: The command can\(aqt be delivered to the instance. The instance might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don\(aqt count against the parent command\(aqs \fBMaxErrors\fP limit and don\(aqt contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
.IP \(bu 2
Terminated: The parent command exceeded its \fBMaxErrors\fP limit and subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.

.SH NAME
logs-get-log-events \- Lists log events from the specified log stream
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists log events from the specified log stream. You can list all of the log events or filter using a time range.
.sp
By default, this operation returns as many log events as can fit in a response size of 1MB (up to 10,000 log events). You can get additional log events by specifying one of the tokens in a subsequent call. This operation can return empty results while there are more log events available through the token.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-log\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the log group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-log\-stream\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the log stream.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-start\-time\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The start of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Events with a timestamp equal to this time or later than this time are included. Events with a timestamp earlier than this time are not included.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-end\-time\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The end of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Events with a timestamp equal to or later than this time are not included.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)
.sp
Using this token works only when you specify \fBtrue\fP for \fBstartFromHead\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-limit\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of log events returned. If you don\(aqt specify a value, the maximum is as many log events as can fit in a response size of 1 MB, up to 10,000 log events.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-start\-from\-head\fP | \fB\-\-no\-start\-from\-head\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the value is true, the earliest log events are returned first. If the value is false, the latest log events are returned first. The default value is false.
.sp
If you are using \fBnextToken\fP in this operation, you must specify \fBtrue\fP for \fBstartFromHead\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

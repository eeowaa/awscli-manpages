.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a health check.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Amazon Route 53 does not prevent you from deleting a health check even if the health check is associated with one or more resource record sets. If you delete a health check and you don\(aqt update the associated resource record sets, the future status of the health check can\(aqt be predicted and may change. This will affect the routing of DNS queries for your DNS failover configuration. For more information, see \fI\%Replacing and Deleting Health Checks\fP in the \fIAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide\fP .

If you\(aqre using AWS Cloud Map and you configured Cloud Map to create a Route 53 health check when you register an instance, you can\(aqt use the Route 53 \fBDeleteHealthCheck\fP command to delete the health check. The health check is deleted automatically when you deregister the instance; there can be a delay of several hours before the health check is deleted from Route 53.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

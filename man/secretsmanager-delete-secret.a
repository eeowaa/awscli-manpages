.SH NAME
secretsmanager-delete-secret \- Deletes an entire secret and all of the versions
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes an entire secret and all of the versions. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. If you don\(aqt specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a \fBDeletionDate\fP stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.
.sp
At any time before recovery window ends, you can use  RestoreSecret to remove the \fBDeletionDate\fP and cancel the deletion of the secret.
.sp
You cannot access the encrypted secret information in any secret scheduled for deletion. If you need to access that information, you must cancel the deletion with  RestoreSecret and then retrieve the information.

.IP \(bu 2
There is no explicit operation to delete a version of a secret. Instead, remove all staging labels from the \fBVersionStage\fP field of a version. That marks the version as deprecated and allows Secrets Manager to delete it as needed. Versions without any staging labels do not show up in  ListSecretVersionIds unless you specify \fBIncludeDeprecated\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
The permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period is performed as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the actual delete operation to occur.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-secret\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the secret to delete. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
.sp
If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the \(aqfriendly name\(aq, you \fImust\fP not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a \fIResourceNotFoundException\fP or an \fIAccessDeniedException\fP error, depending on your permissions.

\fB\-\-recovery\-window\-in\-days\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Specifies the number of days that Secrets Manager waits before Secrets Manager can delete the secret. You can\(aqt use both this parameter and the \fBForceDeleteWithoutRecovery\fP parameter in the same API call.
.sp
This value can range from 7 to 30 days with a default value of 30.

.sp
\fB\-\-force\-delete\-without\-recovery\fP | \fB\-\-no\-force\-delete\-without\-recovery\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Specifies that the secret is to be deleted without any recovery window. You can\(aqt use both this parameter and the \fBRecoveryWindowInDays\fP parameter in the same API call.
.sp
An asynchronous background process performs the actual deletion, so there can be a short delay before the operation completes. If you write code to delete and then immediately recreate a secret with the same name, ensure that your code includes appropriate back off and retry logic.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal waiting period before the permanent deletion that AWS would normally impose with the \fBRecoveryWindowInDays\fP parameter. If you delete a secret with the \fBForceDeleteWithouRecovery\fP parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. You lose the secret permanently.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you use this parameter and include a previously deleted or nonexistent secret, the operation does not return the error \fBResourceNotFoundException\fP in order to correctly handle retries.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBTo delete a secret\fP
.sp
The following example shows how to delete a secret. The secret stays in your account in a deprecated and inaccessible state until the recovery window ends. After the date and time in the \fBDeletionDate\fP response field has passed, you can no longer recover this secret with restore\-secret.

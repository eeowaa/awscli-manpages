.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Removes the specified account from the organization.
.sp
The removed account becomes a standalone account that isn\(aqt a member of any organization. It\(aqs no longer subject to any policies and is responsible for its own bill payments. The organization\(aqs management account is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member account after it\(aqs removed from the organization.
.sp
This operation can be called only from the organization\(aqs management account. Member accounts can remove themselves with  LeaveOrganization instead.

You can remove an account from your organization only if the account is configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is \fInot\fP automatically collected. For an account that you want to make standalone, you must choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment method. AWS uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS activity that occurs while the account isn\(aqt attached to an organization. To remove an account that doesn\(aqt yet have this information, you must sign in as the member account and follow the steps at \fI\%To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide.\fP
.IP \(bu 2
The account that you want to leave must not be a delegated administrator account for any AWS service enabled for your organization. If the account is a delegated administrator, you must first change the delegated administrator account to another account that is remaining in the organization.
.IP \(bu 2
After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were attached to the account object in the organization are deleted. AWS accounts outside of an organization do not support tags.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-account\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0

The unique identifier (ID) of the member account that you want to remove from the organization.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

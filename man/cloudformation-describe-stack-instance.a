\fB\-\-call\-as\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
[Service\-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization\(aqs management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.
.sp
By default, \fBSELF\fP is specified. Use \fBSELF\fP for stack sets with self\-managed permissions.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you are signed in to the management account, specify \fBSELF\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify \fBDELEGATED_ADMIN\fP . Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see \fI\%Register a delegated administrator\fP in the \fIAWS CloudFormation User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the stack instance, in terms of its synchronization with its associated stack set.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINOPERABLE\fP : A \fBDeleteStackInstances\fP operation has failed and left the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from further \fBUpdateStackSet\fP operations. You might need to perform a \fBDeleteStackInstances\fP operation, with \fBRetainStacks\fP set to \fBtrue\fP , to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOUTDATED\fP : The stack isn\(aqt currently up to date with the stack set because:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
The associated stack failed during a \fBCreateStackSet\fP or \fBUpdateStackSet\fP operation.
.IP \(bu 2
The stack was part of a \fBCreateStackSet\fP or \fBUpdateStackSet\fP operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was created or updated.

.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP : The operation in the specified account and Region failed. If the stack set operation fails in enough accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the stack set operation as a whole might be exceeded.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINOPERABLE\fP : A \fBDeleteStackInstances\fP operation has failed and left the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from further \fBUpdateStackSet\fP operations. You might need to perform a \fBDeleteStackInstances\fP operation, with \fBRetainStacks\fP set to \fBtrue\fP , to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPENDING\fP : The operation in the specified account and Region has yet to start.

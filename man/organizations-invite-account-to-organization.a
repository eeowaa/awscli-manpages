You can invite AWS accounts only from the same seller as the management account. For example, if your organization\(aqs management account was created by Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd (AISPL), an AWS seller in India, you can invite only other AISPL accounts to your organization. You can\(aqt combine accounts from AISPL and AWS or from any other AWS seller. For more information, see \fI\%Consolidated Billing in India\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
If you receive an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization or that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists after an hour, contact \fI\%AWS Support\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
A list of tags that you want to attach to the account when it becomes a member of the organization. For each tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key and a value.

.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Any tags in the request are checked for compliance with any applicable tag policies when the request is made. The request is rejected if the tags in the request don\(aqt match the requirements of the policy at that time. Tag policy compliance is * \fBnot\fP * checked again when the invitation is accepted and the tags are actually attached to the account. That means that if the tag policy changes between the invitation and the acceptance, then that tags could potentially be non\-compliant.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBOPEN\fP : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some policy types) and all recipients have responded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake action.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCANCELED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because it was canceled by the originating account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACCEPTED\fP : This handshake is complete because it has been accepted by the recipient.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDECLINED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because it was declined by the recipient account.

.IP \(bu 2
\fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP : This type of handshake represents a request to enable all features in an organization. It is always sent from the management account to only \fIinvited\fP member accounts. Created accounts do not receive this because those accounts were created by the organization\(aqs management account and approval is inferred.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAPPROVE_ALL_FEATURES\fP : This type of handshake is sent from the Organizations service when all member accounts have approved the \fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP invitation. It is sent only to the management account and signals the master that it can finalize the process to enable all features.

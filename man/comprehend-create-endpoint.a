.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-endpoint\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This is the descriptive suffix that becomes part of the \fBEndpointArn\fP used for all subsequent requests to this resource.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-model\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the endpoint will be attached.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-desired\-inference\-units\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The desired number of inference units to be used by the model using this endpoint. Each inference unit represents of a throughput of 100 characters per second.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-client\-request\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An idempotency token provided by the customer. If this token matches a previous endpoint creation request, Amazon Comprehend will not return a \fBResourceInUseException\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Tags associated with the endpoint being created. A tag is a key\-value pair that adds metadata to the endpoint. For example, a tag with "Sales" as the key might be added to an endpoint to indicate its use by the sales department.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A key\-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with the key\-value pair ‘Department’:’Sales’ might be added to a resource to indicate its use by a particular department.
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The initial part of a key\-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show which resources are used by which departments, you might use “Department” as the key portion of the pair, with multiple possible values such as “sales,” “legal,” and “administration.”
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The second part of a key\-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show which resources are used by which departments, you might use “Department” as the initial (key) portion of the pair, with a value of “sales” to indicate the sales department.

\fB\-\-data\-access\-role\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend read access to trained custom models encrypted with a customer managed key (ModelKmsKeyId).

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

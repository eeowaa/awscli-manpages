\fB\-\-workteam\-name\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-member\-definitions\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of \fBMemberDefinition\fP objects that contains objects that identify the workers that make up the work team.
.sp
Workforces can be created using Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon Cognito use \fBCognitoMemberDefinition\fP . For workforces created using your own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use \fBOidcMemberDefinition\fP . Do not provide input for both of these parameters in a single request.
.sp
For workforces created using Amazon Cognito, private work teams correspond to Amazon Cognito \fIuser groups\fP within the user pool used to create a workforce. All of the \fBCognitoMemberDefinition\fP objects that make up the member definition must have the same \fBClientId\fP and \fBUserPool\fP values. To add a Amazon Cognito user group to an existing worker pool, see \fI\%Adding groups to a User Pool . For more information about user pools, see \(gaAmazon Cognito User Pools\fP .
.sp
For workforces created using your own OIDC IdP, specify the user groups that you want to include in your private work team in \fBOidcMemberDefinition\fP by listing those groups in \fBGroups\fP .

OidcMemberDefinition \-> (structure)

.INDENT 3.5
A list user groups that exist in your OIDC Identity Provider (IdP). One to ten groups can be used to create a single private work team. When you add a user group to the list of \fBGroups\fP , you can add that user group to one or more private work teams. If you add a user group to a private work team, all workers in that user group are added to the work team.
.sp
Groups \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

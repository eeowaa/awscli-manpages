.SH NAME
acm-export-certificate \- Exports a private certificate issued by a private certificate authority (CA) for use anywhere
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Exports a private certificate issued by a private certificate authority (CA) for use anywhere. The exported file contains the certificate, the certificate chain, and the encrypted private 2048\-bit RSA key associated with the public key that is embedded in the certificate. For security, you must assign a passphrase for the private key when exporting it.
.sp
For information about exporting and formatting a certificate using the ACM console or CLI, see \fI\%Export a Private Certificate\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-certificate\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the issued certificate. This must be of the form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBarn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/12345678\-1234\-1234\-1234\-123456789012\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-passphrase\fP (blob)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Passphrase to associate with the encrypted exported private key. If you want to later decrypt the private key, you must have the passphrase. You can use the following OpenSSL command to decrypt a private key:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBopenssl rsa \-in encrypted_key.pem \-out decrypted_key.pem\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

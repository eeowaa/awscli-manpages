.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-file\-system\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the file system that you want to update.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-throughput\-mode\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Updates the file system\(aqs throughput mode. If you\(aqre not updating your throughput mode, you don\(aqt need to provide this value in your request. If you are changing the \fBThroughputMode\fP to \fBprovisioned\fP , you must also set a value for \fBProvisionedThroughputInMibps\fP .
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbursting\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBprovisioned\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-provisioned\-throughput\-in\-mibps\fP (double)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Sets the amount of provisioned throughput, in MiB/s, for the file system. Valid values are 1\-1024. If you are changing the throughput mode to provisioned, you must also provide the amount of provisioned throughput. Required if \fBThroughputMode\fP is changed to \fBprovisioned\fP on update.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You can add tags to a file system, including a \fBName\fP tag. For more information, see  CreateFileSystem . If the file system has a \fBName\fP tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
SizeInBytes \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in its \fBValue\fP field, and the time at which that size was determined in its \fBTimestamp\fP field. The \fBTimestamp\fP value is the integer number of seconds since 1970\-01\-01T00:00:00Z. The \fBSizeInBytes\fP value doesn\(aqt represent the size of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the file system. That is, \fBSizeInBytes\fP represents actual size only if the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size that the file system was at any point in time.

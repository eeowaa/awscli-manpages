route53resolver-update-firewall-rule-group-association \- Changes the association of a  FirewallRuleGroup with a VPC
.SH DESCRIPTION

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-rule\-group\-association\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier of the  FirewallRuleGroupAssociation .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-priority\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The setting that determines the processing order of the rule group among the rule groups that you associate with the specified VPC. DNS Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from rule group with the lowest numeric priority setting.
.sp
You must specify a unique priority for each rule group that you associate with a single VPC. To make it easier to insert rule groups later, leave space between the numbers, for example, use 100, 200, and so on. You can change the priority setting for a rule group association after you create it.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-mutation\-protection\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If enabled, this setting disallows modification or removal of the association, to help prevent against accidentally altering DNS firewall protections.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0

\fBDISABLED\fP

\fB\-\-name\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The name of the rule group association.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

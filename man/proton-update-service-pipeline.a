.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Update the service pipeline.
.sp
There are four modes for updating a service pipeline as described in the following. The \fBdeploymentType\fP field defines the mode.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBNONE\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this mode, a deployment \fIdoesn\(aqt\fP occur. Only the requested metadata parameters are updated.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBCURRENT_VERSION\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the new spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are updated. \fIDon’t\fP include minor or major version parameters when you use this \fBdeployment\-type\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBMINOR_VERSION\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor version of the current major version in use.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBMAJOR_VERSION\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the current template by default. You can also specify a different major version that is higher than the major version in use and a minor version (optional).

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to \fBStopModel\fP completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For example, An issue, such as an network outage, might prevent you from getting a response from \fBStopModel\fP . In this case, safely retry your call to \fBStopModel\fP by using the same \fBClientToken\fP parameter value. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for \fBClientToken\fP is considered a new call to \fBStopModel\fP . An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
fsx-create-backup \- Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx file system. Creating regular backups for your file system is a best practice, enabling you to restore a file system from a backup if an issue arises with the original file system.
.sp
For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for file systems with the following configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a Persistent deployment type
.IP \(bu 2
is \fInot\fP linked to a data respository.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, see \fI\%Working with FSx for Lustre backups\fP .
.sp
For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Windows file systems, see \fI\%Working with FSx for Windows backups\fP .
.sp
If a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing backup. If a backup specified client request token exists, and the parameters don\(aqt match, this operation returns \fBIncompatibleParameterError\fP . If a backup with the specified client request token doesn\(aqt exist, \fBCreateBackup\fP does the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of \fBCREATING\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
Returns the description of the backup.
.UNINDENT
.sp
By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a \fBCreateBackup\fP operation without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same.
.sp
The \fBCreateBackup\fP operation returns while the backup\(aqs lifecycle state is still \fBCREATING\fP . You can check the backup creation status by calling the  DescribeBackups operation, which returns the backup state along with other information.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

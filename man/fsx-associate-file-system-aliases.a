.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Use this action to associate one or more Domain Name Server (DNS) aliases with an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. A file systen can have a maximum of 50 DNS aliases associated with it at any one time. If you try to associate a DNS alias that is already associated with the file system, FSx takes no action on that alias in the request. For more information, see \fI\%Working with DNS Aliases\fP and \fI\%Walkthrough 5: Using DNS aliases to access your file system\fP , including additional steps you must take to be able to access your file system using a DNS alias.
.sp
The system response shows the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting to associate with the file system. Use the API operation to monitor the status of the aliases Amazon FSx is associating with the file system.
.sp

\fB\-\-client\-request\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
\fB\-\-aliases\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of one or more DNS alias names to associate with the file system. The alias name has to comply with the following formatting requirements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Formatted as a fully\-qualified domain name (FQDN), * \fBhostname.domain\fP * , for example, \fBaccounting.corp.example.com\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
Can contain alphanumeric characters and the hyphen (\-).
.IP \(bu 2
Cannot start or end with a hyphen.
.IP \(bu 2
Can start with a numeric.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For DNS alias names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as lowercase letters (a\-z), regardless of how you specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters in escape codes.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
mturk-list-assignments-for-hit \- The ListAssignmentsForHIT operation retrieves completed assignments for a HIT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBListAssignmentsForHIT\fP operation retrieves completed assignments for a HIT. You can use this operation to retrieve the results for a HIT.
.sp
You can get assignments for a HIT at any time, even if the HIT is not yet Reviewable. If a HIT requested multiple assignments, and has received some results but has not yet become Reviewable, you can still retrieve the partial results with this operation.
.sp
Use the AssignmentStatus parameter to control which set of assignments for a HIT are returned. The ListAssignmentsForHIT operation can return submitted assignments awaiting approval, or it can return assignments that have already been approved or rejected. You can set AssignmentStatus=Approved,Rejected to get assignments that have already been approved and rejected together in one result set.
.sp
Only the Requester who created the HIT can retrieve the assignments for that HIT.
.sp
Results are sorted and divided into numbered pages and the operation returns a single page of results. You can use the parameters of the operation to control sorting and pagination.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

\fBlist\-assignments\-for\-hit\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBAssignments\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-game\-server\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the game server group where the game server is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-game\-server\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server information to be retrieved.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
GameServer \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Object that describes the requested game server.
.sp
GameServerGroupName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the game server group where the game server is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
GameServerGroupArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN identifier for the game server group where the game server is located.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
GameServerId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server. Game server IDs are developer\-defined and are unique across all game server groups in an AWS account.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
InstanceId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the instance where the game server is running. This ID is available in the instance metadata. EC2 instance IDs use a 17\-character format, for example: \fBi\-1234567890abcdef0\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ConnectionInfo \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The port and IP address that must be used to establish a client connection to the game server.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
GameServerData \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game client or service when it requests information on game servers using  ListGameServers or  ClaimGameServer .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ClaimStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates when an available game server has been reserved for gameplay but has not yet started hosting a game. Once it is claimed, the game server remains in \fBCLAIMED\fP status for a maximum of one minute. During this time, game clients connect to the game server to start the game and trigger the game server to update its utilization status. After one minute, the game server claim status reverts to null.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
UtilizationStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new games or is busy. Possible statuses include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAVAILABLE\fP \- The game server is available to be claimed. A game server that has been claimed remains in this status until it reports game hosting activity.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUTILIZED\fP \- The game server is currently hosting a game session with players.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
RegistrationTime \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Timestamp that indicates when the game server was created with a  RegisterGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \fB"1469498468.057"\fP ).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
LastClaimTime \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \fB"1469498468.057"\fP ). This value is used to calculate when a claimed game server\(aqs status should revert to null.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
LastHealthCheckTime \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was updated with health status using an  UpdateGameServer request. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \fB"1469498468.057"\fP ). After game server registration, this property is only changed when a game server update specifies a health check value.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Simulate how a set of IAM policies and optionally a resource\-based policy works with a list of API operations and AWS resources to determine the policies\(aq effective permissions. The policies are provided as strings.
.sp
The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations. You can simulate resources that don\(aqt exist in your account.
.sp
If you want to simulate existing policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role, use  SimulatePrincipalPolicy instead.
.sp
Context keys are variables that are maintained by AWS and its services and which provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the \fBCondition\fP element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy .
.sp
If the output is long, you can use \fBMaxItems\fP and \fBMarker\fP parameters to paginate the results.
.sp
For more information about using the policy simulator, see \fI\%Testing IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
See also: AWS API Documentation
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBsimulate\-custom\-policy\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBEvaluationResults\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-policy\-input\-list\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of policy documents to include in the simulation. Each document is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy. Do not include any resource\-based policies in this parameter. Any resource\-based policy must be submitted with the \fBResourcePolicy\fP parameter. The policies cannot be "scope\-down" policies, such as you could include in a call to \fI\%GetFederationToken\fP or one of the \fI\%AssumeRole\fP API operations. In other words, do not use policies designed to restrict what a user can do while using the temporary credentials.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\fB\eu0020\fP ) through the end of the ASCII character range
.IP \(bu 2
The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin\-1 Supplement character set (through \fB\eu00FF\fP )

.INDENT 3.5
The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that an IAM entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see \fI\%Permissions boundaries for IAM entities\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . The policy input is specified as a string that contains the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy.

\fB\-\-resource\-arns\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of ARNs of AWS resources to include in the simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then the value defaults to \fB*\fP (all resources). Each API in the \fBActionNames\fP parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. You can simulate resources that don\(aqt exist in your account.
.sp
The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the \fBResourcePolicy\fP parameter.
.sp
If you include a \fBResourcePolicy\fP , then it must be applicable to all of the resources included in the simulation or you receive an invalid input error.

\fB\-\-resource\-owner\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An ARN representing the AWS account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If \fBResourceOwner\fP is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any \fBResourcePolicy\fP included in the simulation. If the \fBResourceOwner\fP parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in \fBCallerArn\fP . This parameter is required only if you specify a resource\-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user \fBCallerArn\fP .
.sp
The ARN for an account uses the following syntax: \fBarn:aws:iam::*AWS\-account\-ID* :root\fP . For example, to represent the account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN: \fBarn:aws:iam::112233445566\-ID:root\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-caller\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the IAM user that you want to use as the simulated caller of the API operations. \fBCallerArn\fP is required if you include a \fBResourcePolicy\fP so that the policy\(aqs \fBPrincipal\fP element has a value to use in evaluating the policy.
.sp
You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.

\fB\-\-resource\-handling\-option\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource\-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.
.sp
Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security\-group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network\-interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see \fI\%Supported platforms\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)

\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

If an AWS Organizations SCP included in the evaluation denies access, the simulation ends. In this case, policy evaluation does not proceed any further and this parameter is not returned.

MatchedStatements \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of the statements in the input policies that determine the result for this part of the simulation. Remember that even if multiple statements allow the operation on the resource, if \fIany\fP statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny overrides any allow. In addition, the deny statement is the only entry included in the result.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains a reference to a \fBStatement\fP element in a policy document that determines the result of the simulation.

MissingContextValues \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when a list of ARNs is included in the \fBResourceArns\fP parameter instead of "*". If you do not specify individual resources, by setting \fBResourceArns\fP to "*" or by not including the \fBResourceArns\fP parameter, then any missing context values are instead included under the \fBEvaluationResults\fP section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has on a policy simulation when that boundary is applied to an IAM entity.
.sp
AllowedByPermissionsBoundary \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of \fBtrue\fP means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an \fBAllow\fP statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity\-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of \fBfalse\fP means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary. In both of these cases, the action is not allowed, regardless of the identity\-based policy.

IsTruncated \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the \fBMarker\fP request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the \fBMaxItems\fP number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check \fBIsTruncated\fP after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

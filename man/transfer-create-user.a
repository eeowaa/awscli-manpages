.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a user and associates them with an existing file transfer protocol\-enabled server. You can only create and associate users with servers that have the \fBIdentityProviderType\fP set to \fBSERVICE_MANAGED\fP . Using parameters for \fBCreateUser\fP , you can specify the user name, set the home directory, store the user\(aqs public key, and assign the user\(aqs AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. You can also optionally add a scope\-down policy, and assign metadata with tags that can be used to group and search for users.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-home\-directory\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client.
.sp
A \fBHomeDirectory\fP example is \fB/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-home\-directory\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users\(aq home directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to \fBPATH\fP , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it \fBLOGICAL\fP , you will need to provide mappings in the \fBHomeDirectoryMappings\fP for how you want to make Amazon S3 paths visible to your users.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPATH\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBLOGICAL\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-home\-directory\-mappings\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You will need to specify the \fBEntry\fP and \fBTarget\fP pair, where \fBEntry\fP shows how the path is made visible and \fBTarget\fP is the actual Amazon S3 or EFS path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your IAM role provides access to paths in \fBTarget\fP . This value can only be set when \fBHomeDirectoryType\fP is set to \fBLOGICAL\fP .
.sp
The following is an \fBEntry\fP and \fBTarget\fP pair example.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB[ { "Entry": "your\-personal\-report.pdf", "Target": "/bucket3/customized\-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf" } ]\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope\-down policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("\fBchroot\fP "). To do this, you can set \fBEntry\fP to \fB/\fP and set \fBTarget\fP to the HomeDirectory parameter value.
.sp
The following is an \fBEntry\fP and \fBTarget\fP pair example for \fBchroot\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB[ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the \fBs3api\fP or \fBefsapi\fP call instead of \fBs3\fP or \fBefs\fP so you can use the put\-object operation. For example, you use the following: \fBaws s3api put\-object \-\-bucket bucketname \-\-key path/to/folder/\fP . Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a \fB/\fP for it to be considered a folder.

\fB\-\-policy\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A scope\-down policy for your user so you can use the same IAM role across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include \fB${Transfer:UserName}\fP , \fB${Transfer:HomeDirectory}\fP , and \fB${Transfer:HomeBucket}\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This only applies when domain of ServerId is S3. EFS does not use scope down policy.
.sp
For scope\-down policies, AWS Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the \fBPolicy\fP argument.
.sp
For an example of a scope\-down policy, see \fI\%Example scope\-down policy\fP .

\fB\-\-role\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the IAM role that controls your users\(aq access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The policies attached to this role will determine the level of access you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users\(aq transfer requests.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

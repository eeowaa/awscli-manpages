gamelift-delete-vpc-peering-connection \- Removes a VPC peering connection
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Removes a VPC peering connection. To delete the connection, you must have a valid authorization for the VPC peering connection that you want to delete. You can check for an authorization by calling  DescribeVpcPeeringAuthorizations or request a new one using  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization .
.sp
Once a valid authorization exists, call this operation from the AWS account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the connection to delete by the connection ID and fleet ID. If successful, the connection is removed.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

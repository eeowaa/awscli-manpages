.SH NAME
iam-put-role-policy \- Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role.
.sp
When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role\(aqs access (permissions) policy. The role\(aqs trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using  CreateRole . You can update a role\(aqs trust policy using  UpdateAssumeRolePolicy . For more information about IAM roles, see \fI\%Using roles to delegate permissions and federate identities\fP .
.sp
A role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a role, use  AttachRolePolicy . To create a new managed policy, use  CreatePolicy . For information about policies, see \fI\%Managed policies and inline policies\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed with a role, see \fI\%IAM and STS quotas\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling \fBPutRolePolicy\fP . For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see \fI\%Making query requests\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-role\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the role to associate the policy with.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-

\fB\-\-policy\-name\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-policy\-document\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The policy document.
.sp
You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for AWS CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. AWS CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\fB\eu0020\fP ) through the end of the ASCII character range
.IP \(bu 2
The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin\-1 Supplement character set (through \fB\eu00FF\fP )
.IP \(bu 2
The special characters tab (\fB\eu0009\fP ), line feed (\fB\eu000A\fP ), and carriage return (\fB\eu000D\fP )

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

The policy is defined as a JSON document in the \fIAdminPolicy.json\fP file. (The file name and extension do not have significance.)

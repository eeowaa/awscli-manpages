.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-ignore\-words\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array that lists specific character sequences (ignore words) to exclude from the results. If the text matched by the regular expression is the same as any string in this array, Amazon Macie ignores it. The array can contain as many as 10 ignore words. Each ignore word can contain 4 \- 90 characters. Ignore words are case sensitive.

\fB\-\-keywords\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array that lists specific character sequences (keywords), one of which must be within proximity (maximumMatchDistance) of the regular expression to match. The array can contain as many as 50 keywords. Each keyword can contain 3 \- 90 characters. Keywords aren\(aqt case sensitive.

\fB\-\-maximum\-match\-distance\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of characters that can exist between text that matches the regex pattern and the character sequences specified by the keywords array. Macie includes or excludes a result based on the proximity of a keyword to text that matches the regex pattern. The distance can be 1 \- 300 characters. The default value is 50.

\fB\-\-regex\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The regular expression (\fIregex\fP ) that defines the pattern to match. The expression can contain as many as 512 characters.

\fB\-\-sample\-text\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The sample text to inspect by using the custom data identifier. The text can contain as many as 1,000 characters.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns information about the SSH public keys associated with the specified IAM user. If none exists, the operation returns an empty list.
.sp
The SSH public keys returned by this operation are used only for authenticating the IAM user to an AWS CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an AWS CodeCommit repository, see \fI\%Set up AWS CodeCommit for SSH connections\fP in the \fIAWS CodeCommit User Guide\fP .
.sp
Although each user is limited to a small number of keys, you can still paginate the results using the \fBMaxItems\fP and \fBMarker\fP parameters.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBlist\-ssh\-public\-keys\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBSSHPublicKeys\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-user\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the IAM user to list SSH public keys for. If none is specified, the \fBUserName\fP field is determined implicitly based on the AWS access key used to sign the request.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
SSHPublicKeys \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of the SSH public keys assigned to IAM user.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains information about an SSH public key, without the key\(aqs body or fingerprint.
.sp
This data type is used as a response element in the  ListSSHPublicKeys operation.
.sp
UserName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the IAM user associated with the SSH public key.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SSHPublicKeyId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the SSH public key.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the SSH public key. \fBActive\fP means that the key can be used for authentication with an AWS CodeCommit repository. \fBInactive\fP means that the key cannot be used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
UploadDate \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The date and time, in \fI\%ISO 8601 date\-time format\fP , when the SSH public key was uploaded.

.sp
IsTruncated \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the \fBMarker\fP request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the \fBMaxItems\fP number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check \fBIsTruncated\fP after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Marker \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When \fBIsTruncated\fP is \fBtrue\fP , this element is present and contains the value to use for the \fBMarker\fP parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

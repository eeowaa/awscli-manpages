.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-application\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the application. This identifier is displayed as the \fBProject ID\fP on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of items to include in each page of a paginated response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign, and journey metrics.

.sp
\fB\-\-segment\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the segment.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The NextToken string that specifies which page of results to return in a paginated response.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

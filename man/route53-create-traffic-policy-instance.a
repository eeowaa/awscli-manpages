.SH NAME
route53-create-traffic-policy-instance \- Creates resource record sets in a specified hosted zone based on the settings in a specified traffic policy version
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates resource record sets in a specified hosted zone based on the settings in a specified traffic policy version. In addition, \fBCreateTrafficPolicyInstance\fP associates the resource record sets with a specified domain name (such as example.com) or subdomain name (such as www.example.com). Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries for the domain or subdomain name by using the resource record sets that \fBCreateTrafficPolicyInstance\fP created.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

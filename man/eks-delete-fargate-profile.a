.SH NAME
eks-delete-fargate-profile \- Deletes an AWS Fargate profile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes an AWS Fargate profile.
.sp
When you delete a Fargate profile, any pods running on Fargate that were created with the profile are deleted. If those pods match another Fargate profile, then they are scheduled on Fargate with that profile. If they no longer match any Fargate profiles, then they are not scheduled on Fargate and they may remain in a pending state.
.sp
Only one Fargate profile in a cluster can be in the \fBDELETING\fP status at a time. You must wait for a Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can delete any other profiles in that cluster.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

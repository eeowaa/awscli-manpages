cloudsearchdomain-suggest \- Retrieves autocomplete suggestions for a partial query string
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves autocomplete suggestions for a partial query string. You can use suggestions enable you to display likely matches before users finish typing. In Amazon CloudSearch, suggestions are based on the contents of a particular text field. When you request suggestions, Amazon CloudSearch finds all of the documents whose values in the suggester field start with the specified query string. The beginning of the field must match the query string to be considered a match.
.sp
For more information about configuring suggesters and retrieving suggestions, see \fI\%Getting Suggestions\fP in the \fIAmazon CloudSearch Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
The endpoint for submitting \fBSuggest\fP requests is domain\-specific. You submit suggest requests to a domain\(aqs search endpoint. To get the search endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service \fBDescribeDomains\fP action. A domain\(aqs endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

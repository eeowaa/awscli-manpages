.SH NAME
opsworks-cm-restore-server \- Restores a backup to a server that is in a CONNECTION_LOST , HEALTHY , RUNNING , UNHEALTHY , or TERMINATED state
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Restores a backup to a server that is in a \fBCONNECTION_LOST\fP , \fBHEALTHY\fP , \fBRUNNING\fP , \fBUNHEALTHY\fP , or \fBTERMINATED\fP state. When you run RestoreServer, the server\(aqs EC2 instance is deleted, and a new EC2 instance is configured. RestoreServer maintains the existing server endpoint, so configuration management of the server\(aqs client devices (nodes) should continue to work.
.sp
Restoring from a backup is performed by creating a new EC2 instance. If restoration is successful, and the server is in a \fBHEALTHY\fP state, AWS OpsWorks CM switches traffic over to the new instance. After restoration is finished, the old EC2 instance is maintained in a \fBRunning\fP or \fBStopped\fP state, but is eventually terminated.
.sp
This operation is asynchronous.
.sp
An \fBInvalidStateException\fP is thrown when the server is not in a valid state. A \fBResourceNotFoundException\fP is thrown when the server does not exist. A \fBValidationException\fP is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

\fB\-\-backup\-id\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the backup that you want to use to restore a server.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

The name of the server that you want to restore.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-instance\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of instance to restore. Valid values must be specified in the following format: \fB^([cm][34]|t2).*\fP For example, \fBm5.large\fP . Valid values are \fBm5.large\fP , \fBr5.xlarge\fP , and \fBr5.2xlarge\fP . If you do not specify this parameter, RestoreServer uses the instance type from the specified backup.

.sp
\fB\-\-key\-pair\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the key pair to set on the new EC2 instance. This can be helpful if the administrator no longer has the SSH key.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo restore a server\fP
.sp
The following \fBrestore\-server\fP command performs an in\-place restoration of a
Chef Automate server named \fBautomate\-06\fP in your default region from a backup
with an ID of \fBautomate\-06\-2016\-11\-22T16:13:27.998Z\fP\&. Restoring a server restores
connections to the nodes that the Chef Automate server was managing at the time
that the specified backup was performed.

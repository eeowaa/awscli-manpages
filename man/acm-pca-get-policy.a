.IP \(bu 2
A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer account, to AWS Organizations, or to an AWS Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see \fI\%Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.
.IP \(bu 2
For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the ACM Private CA policy. For more information, see \fI\%Using a Service Linked Role with ACM\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see \fI\%Attach a Policy for Cross\-Account Access\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

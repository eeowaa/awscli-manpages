.SH NAME
ec2-deregister-image \- Deregisters the specified AMI
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deregisters the specified AMI. After you deregister an AMI, it can\(aqt be used to launch new instances; however, it doesn\(aqt affect any instances that you\(aqve already launched from the AMI. You\(aqll continue to incur usage costs for those instances until you terminate them.
.sp
When you deregister an Amazon EBS\-backed AMI, it doesn\(aqt affect the snapshot that was created for the root volume of the instance during the AMI creation process. When you deregister an instance store\-backed AMI, it doesn\(aqt affect the files that you uploaded to Amazon S3 when you created the AMI.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

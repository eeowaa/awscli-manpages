.SH NAME
ec2-advertise-byoip-cidr \- Advertises an IPv4 or IPv6 address range that is provisioned for use with your AWS resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Advertises an IPv4 or IPv6 address range that is provisioned for use with your AWS resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).
.sp
You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time.
.sp
We recommend that you stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR from other locations when you advertise it from AWS. To minimize down time, you can configure your AWS resources to use an address from a BYOIP CIDR before it is advertised, and then simultaneously stop advertising it from the current location and start advertising it through AWS.
.sp
It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses starts routing to AWS because of BGP propagation delays.
.sp
To stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR, use  WithdrawByoipCidr .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cidr\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The address range, in CIDR notation. This must be the exact range that you provisioned. You can\(aqt advertise only a portion of the provisioned range.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fP | \fB\-\-no\-dry\-run\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \fBDryRunOperation\fP . Otherwise, it is \fBUnauthorizedOperation\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

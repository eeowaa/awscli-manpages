.SH NAME
ssm-create-activation \- Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) with Systems Manager
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on\-premises server or virtual machine (VM) with Systems Manager. Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing on\-premises instances and VMs using Systems Manager, see \fI\%Setting up AWS Systems Manager for hybrid environments\fP in the \fIAWS Systems Manager User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
On\-premises servers or VMs that are registered with Systems Manager and EC2 instances that you manage with Systems Manager are all called \fImanaged instances\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you want to assign to the managed instance. This IAM role must provide AssumeRole permissions for the Systems Manager service principal \fBssm.amazonaws.com\fP . For more information, see \fI\%Create an IAM service role for a hybrid environment\fP in the \fIAWS Systems Manager User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-expiration\-date\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The date by which this activation request should expire, in timestamp format, such as "2021\-07\-07T00:00:00". You can specify a date up to 30 days in advance. If you don\(aqt provide an expiration date, the activation code expires in 24 hours.

.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an activation to identify which servers or virtual machines (VMs) in your on\-premises environment you intend to activate. In this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBKey=OS,Value=Windows\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBKey=Environment,Value=Production\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you install SSM Agent on your on\-premises servers and VMs, you specify an activation ID and code. When you specify the activation ID and code, tags assigned to the activation are automatically applied to the on\-premises servers or VMs.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can\(aqt add tags to or delete tags from an existing activation. You can tag your on\-premises servers and VMs after they connect to Systems Manager for the first time and are assigned a managed instance ID. This means they are listed in the AWS Systems Manager console with an ID that is prefixed with "mi\-". For information about how to add tags to your managed instances, see  AddTagsToResource . For information about how to remove tags from your managed instances, see  RemoveTagsFromResource .
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
Metadata that you assign to your AWS resources. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. In Systems Manager, you can apply tags to documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
After you generate a group or policy report using the \fBGenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails\fP operation, you can use the \fBJobId\fP parameter in \fBGetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities\fP . This operation retrieves the status of your report job and a list of entities that could have used group or policy permissions to access the specified service.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBGroup\fP – For a group report, this operation returns a list of users in the group that could have used the group’s policies in an attempt to access the service.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPolicy\fP – For a policy report, this operation returns a list of entities (users or roles) that could have used the policy in an attempt to access the service.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also use this operation for user or role reports to retrieve details about those entities.
.sp
If the operation fails, the \fBGetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities\fP operation returns the reason that it failed.
.sp
By default, the list of associated entities is sorted by date, with the most recent access listed first.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-job\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the request generated by the \fBGenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails\fP operation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-service\-namespace\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The service namespace for an AWS service. Provide the service namespace to learn when the IAM entity last attempted to access the specified service.
.sp
To learn the service namespace for a service, see \fI\%Actions, resources, and condition keys for AWS services\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, \fB(service prefix: a4b)\fP . For more information about service namespaces, see \fI\%AWS service namespaces\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the \fBIsTruncated\fP response element is \fBtrue\fP .
.sp
If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the \fBIsTruncated\fP response element returns \fBtrue\fP , and \fBMarker\fP contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-marker\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the \fBMarker\fP element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo retrieve a service access report with details for a service\fP
.sp
The following \fBget\-service\-last\-accessed\-details\-with\-entities\fP example retrieves a report that contains details about IAM users and other entities that accessed the specified service. To generate a report, use the \fBgenerate\-service\-last\-accessed\-details\fP command. To get a list of services accessed with namespaces, use \fBget\-service\-last\-accessed\-details\fP\&.

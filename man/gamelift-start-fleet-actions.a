.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Resumes certain types of activity on fleet instances that were suspended with  StopFleetActions . For multi\-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location. Currently, this operation is used to restart a fleet\(aqs auto\-scaling activity.
.sp
This operation can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To restart actions on instances in the fleet\(aqs home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to resume.
.IP \(bu 2
To restart actions on instances in one of the fleet\(aqs remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to resume.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If successful, GameLift once again initiates scaling events as triggered by the fleet\(aqs scaling policies. If actions on the fleet location were never stopped, this operation will have no effect. You can view a fleet\(aqs stopped actions using  DescribeFleetAttributes or  DescribeFleetLocationAttributes .

\fB\-\-location\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

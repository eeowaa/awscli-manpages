route53-delete-vpc-association-authorization \- Removes authorization to submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request to associate a specified VPC with a hosted zone that was created by a different account
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Removes authorization to submit an \fBAssociateVPCWithHostedZone\fP request to associate a specified VPC with a hosted zone that was created by a different account. You must use the account that created the hosted zone to submit a \fBDeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization\fP request.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Sending this request only prevents the AWS account that created the VPC from associating the VPC with the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone in the future. If the VPC is already associated with the hosted zone, \fBDeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization\fP won\(aqt disassociate the VPC from the hosted zone. If you want to delete an existing association, use \fBDisassociateVPCFromHostedZone\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

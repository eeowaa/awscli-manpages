.sp
TargetOnDemandCapacity \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The target capacity of On\-Demand units for the instance fleet, which determines how many On\-Demand Instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision On\-Demand Instances as specified by  InstanceTypeConfig . Each instance configuration has a specified \fBWeightedCapacity\fP . When an On\-Demand Instance is provisioned, the \fBWeightedCapacity\fP units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a \fBWeightedCapacity\fP of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If not specified or set to 0, only Spot Instances are provisioned for the instance fleet using \fBTargetSpotCapacity\fP . At least one of \fBTargetSpotCapacity\fP and \fBTargetOnDemandCapacity\fP should be greater than 0. For a master instance fleet, only one of \fBTargetSpotCapacity\fP and \fBTargetOnDemandCapacity\fP can be specified, and its value must be 1.

.sp
TargetSpotCapacity \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The target capacity of Spot units for the instance fleet, which determines how many Spot Instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision Spot Instances as specified by  InstanceTypeConfig . Each instance configuration has a specified \fBWeightedCapacity\fP . When a Spot Instance is provisioned, the \fBWeightedCapacity\fP units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a \fBWeightedCapacity\fP of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units.

The action to take when \fBTargetSpotCapacity\fP has not been fulfilled when the \fBTimeoutDurationMinutes\fP has expired; that is, when all Spot Instances could not be provisioned within the Spot provisioning timeout. Valid values are \fBTERMINATE_CLUSTER\fP and \fBSWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND\fP . SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND specifies that if no Spot Instances are available, On\-Demand Instances should be provisioned to fulfill any remaining Spot capacity.

.sp
BlockDurationMinutes \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The defined duration for Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks) in minutes.

The duration period starts as soon as a Spot Instance receives its instance ID.

Indicates whether to use unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On\-Demand capacity.
.sp
If you specify \fBuse\-capacity\-reservations\-first\fP , the fleet uses unused Capacity Reservations to fulfill On\-Demand capacity up to the target On\-Demand capacity. If multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On\-Demand allocation strategy (\fBlowest\-price\fP ) is applied. If the number of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On\-Demand target capacity, the remaining On\-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On\-Demand allocation strategy (\fBlowest\-price\fP ).
.sp
If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfils the On\-Demand capacity according to the chosen On\-Demand allocation strategy.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
Indicates the instance\(aqs Capacity Reservation preferences. Possible preferences include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBopen\fP \- The instance can run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnone\fP \- The instance avoids running in a Capacity Reservation even if one is available. The instance runs as an On\-Demand Instance.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

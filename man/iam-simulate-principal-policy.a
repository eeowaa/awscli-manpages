.SH NAME
iam-simulate-principal-policy \- Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with a list of API operations and AWS resources to determine the policies(aq effective permissions
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with a list of API operations and AWS resources to determine the policies\(aq effective permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the simulation also includes all of the policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to. You can simulate resources that don\(aqt exist in your account.
.sp
You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to simulate only policies specified as strings, use  SimulateCustomPolicy instead.
.sp
You can also optionally include one resource\-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation.
.sp
The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBNote:\fP This operation discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user\(aqs permissions, then consider allowing them to use  SimulateCustomPolicy instead.

.sp
Context keys are variables maintained by AWS and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the \fBCondition\fP element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .
.sp
If the output is long, you can use the \fBMaxItems\fP and \fBMarker\fP parameters to paginate the results.
.sp
For more information about using the policy simulator, see \fI\%Testing IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fBsimulate\-principal\-policy\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBEvaluationResults\fP

\fB\-\-permissions\-boundary\-policy\-input\-list\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that the entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. An IAM entity can only have one permissions boundary in effect at a time. For example, if a permissions boundary is attached to an entity and you pass in a different permissions boundary policy using this parameter, then the new permissions boundary policy is used for the simulation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see \fI\%Permissions boundaries for IAM entities\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . The policy input is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy.

\fB\-\-resource\-owner\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An AWS account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If \fBResourceOwner\fP is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any \fBResourcePolicy\fP included in the simulation. If the \fBResourceOwner\fP parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in \fBCallerArn\fP . This parameter is required only if you specify a resource\-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user \fBCallerArn\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-caller\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the IAM user that you want to specify as the simulated caller of the API operations. If you do not specify a \fBCallerArn\fP , it defaults to the ARN of the user that you specify in \fBPolicySourceArn\fP , if you specified a user. If you include both a \fBPolicySourceArn\fP (for example, \fBarn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David\fP ) and a \fBCallerArn\fP (for example, \fBarn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob\fP ), the result is that you simulate calling the API operations as Bob, as if Bob had David\(aqs policies.
.sp
You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBCallerArn\fP is required if you include a \fBResourcePolicy\fP and the \fBPolicySourceArn\fP is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is required so that the resource\-based policy\(aqs \fBPrincipal\fP element has a value to use in evaluating the policy.

\fB\-\-resource\-handling\-option\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource\-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.
.sp
Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see \fI\%Supported platforms\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 User Guide\fP .

MatchedStatements \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of the statements in the input policies that determine the result for this part of the simulation. Remember that even if multiple statements allow the operation on the resource, if \fIany\fP statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny overrides any allow. In addition, the deny statement is the only entry included in the result.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains a reference to a \fBStatement\fP element in a policy document that determines the result of the simulation.
.sp
This data type is used by the \fBMatchedStatements\fP member of the \(ga\(ga  EvaluationResult \(ga\(ga type.

MissingContextValues \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when a list of ARNs is included in the \fBResourceArns\fP parameter instead of "*". If you do not specify individual resources, by setting \fBResourceArns\fP to "*" or by not including the \fBResourceArns\fP parameter, then any missing context values are instead included under the \fBEvaluationResults\fP section. To discover the context keys used by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains information about the effect that a permissions boundary has on a policy simulation when that boundary is applied to an IAM entity.
.sp
AllowedByPermissionsBoundary \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies whether an action is allowed by a permissions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role). A value of \fBtrue\fP means that the permissions boundary does not deny the action. This means that the policy includes an \fBAllow\fP statement that matches the request. In this case, if an identity\-based policy also allows the action, the request is allowed. A value of \fBfalse\fP means that either the requested action is not allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the permissions boundary. In both of these cases, the action is not allowed, regardless of the identity\-based policy.

IsTruncated \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the \fBMarker\fP request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the \fBMaxItems\fP number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check \fBIsTruncated\fP after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

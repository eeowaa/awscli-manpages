\fBDeliveryStatusIAMRole\fP – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.
.sp
\fBDeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate\fP – The percentage of successful SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 \- 100. For example, to write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to \fB0\fP . To write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to \fB10\fP .
.sp
\fBDefaultSenderID\fP – A string, such as your business brand, that is displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 \- 11 alphanumeric characters, and it must contain at least one letter.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the Amazon SNS service principle to perform the \fBs3:PutObject\fP and \fBs3:GetBucketLocation\fP actions.
.sp
For an example bucket policy and usage report, see \fI\%Monitoring SMS Activity\fP in the \fIAmazon SNS Developer Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

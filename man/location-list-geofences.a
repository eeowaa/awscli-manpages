\fBlist\-geofences\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBEntries\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-collection\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the geofence collection storing the list of geofences.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains a list of geofences stored in the geofence collection.

.sp
CreateTime \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The timestamp for when the geofence was stored in a geofence collection in \fI\%ISO 8601\fP format: \fBYYYY\-MM\-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ\fP

GeofenceId \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The geofence identifier.

.sp
Geometry \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains the geofence geometry details describing a polygon.
.sp
Polygon \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of 1 or more linear rings. A linear ring is an array of 4 or more vertices, where the first and last vertex are the same to form a closed boundary. Each vertex is a 2\-dimensional point of the form: \fB[longitude, latitude]\fP .
.sp
The first linear ring is an outer ring, describing the polygon\(aqs boundary. Subsequent linear rings may be inner or outer rings to describe holes and islands. Outer rings must list their vertices in counter\-clockwise order around the ring\(aqs center, where the left side is the polygon\(aqs exterior. Inner rings must list their vertices in clockwise order, where the left side is the polygon\(aqs interior.

.INDENT 3.5
Identifies the state of the geofence. A geofence will hold one of the following states:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACTIVE\fP — The geofence has been indexed by the system.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPENDING\fP — The geofence is being processed by the system.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP — The geofence failed to be indexed by the system.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETED\fP — The geofence has been deleted from the system index.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETING\fP — The geofence is being deleted from the system index.

.SH NAME
sts-get-session-token \- Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use \fBGetSessionToken\fP if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS API operations like Amazon EC2 \fBStopInstances\fP . MFA\-enabled IAM users would need to call \fBGetSessionToken\fP and submit an MFA code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error. For a comparison of \fBGetSessionToken\fP with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see \fI\%Requesting Temporary Security Credentials\fP and \fI\%Comparing the AWS STS API operations\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

\fBSession Duration\fP
.UNINDENT

.sp
The \fBGetSessionToken\fP operation must be called by using the long\-term AWS security credentials of the AWS account root user or an IAM user. Credentials that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration that you specify. This duration can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with a default of 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Credentials based on account credentials can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1 hour.

\fBPermissions\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The temporary security credentials created by \fBGetSessionToken\fP can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication information is included in the request.
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot call any STS API \fIexcept\fP  \fBAssumeRole\fP or \fBGetCallerIdentity\fP .

We recommend that you do not call \fBGetSessionToken\fP with AWS account root user credentials. Instead, follow our \fI\%best practices\fP by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions, and using IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The credentials that are returned by \fBGetSessionToken\fP are based on permissions associated with the user whose credentials were used to call the operation. If \fBGetSessionToken\fP is called using AWS account root user credentials, the temporary credentials have root user permissions. Similarly, if \fBGetSessionToken\fP is called using the credentials of an IAM user, the temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user.
.sp
For more information about using \fBGetSessionToken\fP to create temporary credentials, go to \fI\%Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted Environments\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-duration\-seconds\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain valid. Acceptable durations for IAM user sessions range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12 hours) as the default. Sessions for AWS account owners are restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If the duration is longer than one hour, the session for AWS account owners defaults to one hour.

.sp
\fB\-\-serial\-number\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the IAM user who is making the \fBGetSessionToken\fP call. Specify this value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as \fBGAHT12345678\fP ) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as \fBarn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user\fP ). You can find the device for an IAM user by going to the AWS Management Console and viewing the user\(aqs security credentials.
.sp
The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper\- and lower\-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/\-

.sp
\fB\-\-token\-code\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA is required. If any policy requires the IAM user to submit an MFA code, specify this value. If MFA authentication is required, the user must provide a code when requesting a set of temporary security credentials. A user who fails to provide the code receives an "access denied" response when requesting resources that require MFA authentication.
.sp
The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo get a set of short term credentials for an IAM identity\fP
.sp
The following \fBget\-session\-token\fP example retrieves a set of short\-term credentials for the IAM identity making the call. The resulting credentials can be used for requests where multi\-factor authentication (MFA) is required by policy. The credentials expire 15 minutes after they are generated.

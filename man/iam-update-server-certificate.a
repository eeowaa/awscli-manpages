.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the name and/or the path of the specified server certificate stored in IAM.
.sp
For more information about working with server certificates, see \fI\%Working with server certificates\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . This topic also includes a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

You should understand the implications of changing a server certificate\(aqs path or name. For more information, see \fI\%Renaming a server certificate\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the server certificate with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the certificate named \fBProductionCert\fP to \fBProdCert\fP , the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both certificates. If the principal has permission to update the \fBProductionCert\fP group, but not the \fBProdCert\fP certificate, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see \fI\%Access management\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-server\-certificate\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the server certificate that you want to update.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-new\-path\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The new path for the server certificate. Include this only if you are updating the server certificate\(aqs path.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\fB\eu0021\fP ) through the DEL character (\fB\eu007F\fP ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

.sp
\fB\-\-new\-server\-certificate\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The new name for the server certificate. Include this only if you are updating the server certificate\(aqs name. The name of the certificate cannot contain any spaces.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo change the path or name of a server certificate in your AWS account\fP
.sp
The following \fBupdate\-server\-certificate\fP command changes the name of the certificate from \fBmyServerCertificate\fP to \fBmyUpdatedServerCertificate\fP\&. It also changes the path to \fB/cloudfront/\fP so that it can be accessed by the Amazon CloudFront service. This command produces no output. You can see the results of the update by running the \fBlist\-server\-certificates\fP command.

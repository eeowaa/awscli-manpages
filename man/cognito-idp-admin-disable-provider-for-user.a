.SH NAME
cognito-idp-admin-disable-provider-for-user \- Disables the user from signing in with the specified external (SAML or social) identity provider
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Disables the user from signing in with the specified external (SAML or social) identity provider. If the user to disable is a Cognito User Pools native username + password user, they are not permitted to use their password to sign\-in. If the user to disable is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. The next time the external user (no longer attached to the previously linked \fBDestinationUser\fP ) signs in, they must create a new user account. See \fI\%AdminLinkProviderForUser\fP .
.sp
This action is enabled only for admin access and requires developer credentials.
.sp
The \fBProviderName\fP must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the pool.
.sp
To disable a native username + password user, the \fBProviderName\fP value must be \fBCognito\fP and the \fBProviderAttributeName\fP must be \fBCognito_Subject\fP , with the \fBProviderAttributeValue\fP being the name that is used in the user pool for the user.
.sp
The \fBProviderAttributeName\fP must always be \fBCognito_Subject\fP for social identity providers. The \fBProviderAttributeValue\fP must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user.
.sp
For de\-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign\-in, the \fBProviderAttributeName\fP and \fBProviderAttributeValue\fP must be the same values that were used for the \fBSourceUser\fP when the identities were originally linked using \fBAdminLinkProviderForUser\fP call. (If the linking was done with \fBProviderAttributeName\fP set to \fBCognito_Subject\fP , the same applies here). However, if the user has already signed in, the \fBProviderAttributeName\fP must be \fBCognito_Subject\fP and \fBProviderAttributeValue\fP must be the subject of the SAML assertion.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
detective-create-members \- Sends a request to invite the specified AWS accounts to be member accounts in the behavior graph
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Sends a request to invite the specified AWS accounts to be member accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator account for a behavior graph.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBCreateMembers\fP verifies the accounts and then invites the verified accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the administrator manages their member accounts centrally.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite.
.sp
The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The accounts that \fBCreateMembers\fP was able to start the verification for. This list includes member accounts that are being verified, that have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed verification.
.IP \(bu 2
The accounts that \fBCreateMembers\fP was unable to process. This list includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in the behavior graph.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

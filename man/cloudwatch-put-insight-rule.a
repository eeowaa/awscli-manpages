\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of key\-value pairs to associate with the Contributor Insights rule. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a rule.
.sp
Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only the resources that have certain tag values.
.sp
To be able to associate tags with a rule, you must have the \fBcloudwatch:TagResource\fP permission in addition to the \fBcloudwatch:PutInsightRule\fP permission.
.sp
If you are using this operation to update an existing Contributor Insights rule, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing rule, use \fI\%TagResource\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Posts a batch of documents to a search domain for indexing. A document batch is a collection of add and delete operations that represent the documents you want to add, update, or delete from your domain. Batches can be described in either JSON or XML. Each item that you want Amazon CloudSearch to return as a search result (such as a product) is represented as a document. Every document has a unique ID and one or more fields that contain the data that you want to search and return in results. Individual documents cannot contain more than 1 MB of data. The entire batch cannot exceed 5 MB. To get the best possible upload performance, group add and delete operations in batches that are close the 5 MB limit. Submitting a large volume of single\-document batches can overload a domain\(aqs document service.
.sp
The endpoint for submitting \fBUploadDocuments\fP requests is domain\-specific. To get the document endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service \fBDescribeDomains\fP action. A domain\(aqs endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.
.sp
For more information about formatting your data for Amazon CloudSearch, see \fI\%Preparing Your Data\fP in the \fIAmazon CloudSearch Developer Guide\fP . For more information about uploading data for indexing, see \fI\%Uploading Data\fP in the \fIAmazon CloudSearch Developer Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-documents\fP (blob)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A batch of documents formatted in JSON or HTML.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-content\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The format of the batch you are uploading. Amazon CloudSearch supports two document batch formats:

application/json
.IP \(bu 2
application/xml
.UNINDENT
.sp

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

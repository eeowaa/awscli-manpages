.SH NAME
organizations-enable-all-features \- Enables all features in an organization
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of organization policies that can restrict the services and actions that can be called in each account. Until you enable all features, you have access only to consolidated billing, and you can\(aqt use any of the advanced account administration features that AWS Organizations supports. For more information, see \fI\%Enabling All Features in Your Organization\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide.\fP
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This operation is required only for organizations that were created explicitly with only the consolidated billing features enabled. Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in the organization. The feature set change can be finalized and the additional features enabled only after all administrators in the invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable individual policy types in a root using  EnablePolicyType and  DisablePolicyType . To see the status of policy types in a root, use  ListRoots .
.sp
After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize the feature set change by accepting the handshake that contains \fB"Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"\fP . This completes the change.
.sp
After you enable all features in your organization, the management account in the organization can apply policies on all member accounts. These policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those accounts can do. The management account can apply policies that prevent accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account administrators are aware of this.
.sp
This operation can be called only from the organization\(aqs management account.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo enable all features in an organization\fP
.sp
This example shows the administrator asking all the invited accounts in the organization to approve enabled all features in the organization. AWS Organizations sends an email to the address that is registered with every invited member account asking the owner to approve the change to all features by accepting the handshake that is sent. After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, the organization administrator can finalize the change to all features, and those with appropriate permissions can create policies and apply them to roots, OUs, and accounts:

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBREQUESTED\fP : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some handshake types) and not all recipients have responded yet. The request stays in this state until all recipients respond.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOPEN\fP : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some policy types) and all recipients have responded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake action.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCANCELED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because it was canceled by the originating account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACCEPTED\fP : This handshake is complete because it has been accepted by the recipient.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDECLINED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because it was declined by the recipient account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEXPIRED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because the originator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipient before the expiration time (15 days).

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Action \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of handshake, indicating what action occurs when the recipient accepts the handshake. The following handshake types are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINVITE\fP : This type of handshake represents a request to join an organization. It is always sent from the management account to only non\-member accounts.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP : This type of handshake represents a request to enable all features in an organization. It is always sent from the management account to only \fIinvited\fP member accounts. Created accounts do not receive this because those accounts were created by the organization\(aqs management account and approval is inferred.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAPPROVE_ALL_FEATURES\fP : This type of handshake is sent from the Organizations service when all member accounts have approved the \fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP invitation. It is sent only to the management account and signals the master that it can finalize the process to enable all features.

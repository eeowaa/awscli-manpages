.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Starts the running of the version of an Amazon Lookout for Vision model. Starting a model takes a while to complete. To check the current state of the model, use  DescribeModel .
.sp
A model is ready to use when its status is \fBHOSTED\fP .
.sp
Once the model is running, you can detect custom labels in new images by calling  DetectAnomalies .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You are charged for the amount of time that the model is running. To stop a running model, call  StopModel .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation requires permissions to perform the \fBlookoutvision:StartModel\fP operation.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-project\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the project that contains the model that you want to start.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-model\-version\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The version of the model that you want to start.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-min\-inference\-units\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The minimum number of inference units to use. A single inference unit represents 1 hour of processing and can support up to 5 Transaction Pers Second (TPS). Use a higher number to increase the TPS throughput of your model. You are charged for the number of inference units that you use.

\fB\-\-client\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to \fBStartModel\fP completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For example, An issue, such as an network outage, might prevent you from getting a response from \fBStartModel\fP . In this case, safely retry your call to \fBStartModel\fP by using the same \fBClientToken\fP parameter value. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for \fBClientToken\fP is considered a new call to \fBStartModel\fP . An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

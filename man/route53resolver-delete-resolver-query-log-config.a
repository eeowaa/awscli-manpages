.SH NAME
route53resolver-delete-resolver-query-log-config \- Deletes a query logging configuration
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a query logging configuration. When you delete a configuration, Resolver stops logging DNS queries for all of the Amazon VPCs that are associated with the configuration. This also applies if the query logging configuration is shared with other AWS accounts, and the other accounts have associated VPCs with the shared configuration.
.sp
Before you can delete a query logging configuration, you must first disassociate all VPCs from the configuration. See \fI\%DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig\fP .
.sp
If you used Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other accounts, you must stop sharing the configuration before you can delete a configuration. The accounts that you shared the configuration with can first disassociate VPCs that they associated with the configuration, but that\(aqs not necessary. If you stop sharing the configuration, those VPCs are automatically disassociated from the configuration.

.sp
\fB\-\-resolver\-query\-log\-config\-id\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the query logging configuration that you want to delete.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

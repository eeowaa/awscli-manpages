\fBlist\-operations\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBOperations\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-submitted\-since\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An optional parameter that lets you get information about all the operations that you submitted after a specified date and time. Specify the date and time in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal time (UTC).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo list the status of operations that return an operation ID\fP
.sp
Some domain registration operations run asynchronously and return a response before they finish. These operations return an operation ID that you can use to get the current status. The following \fBlist\-operations\fP command lists summary information, including the status, about the current domain\-registration operations.
.sp
This command runs only in the \fBus\-east\-1\fP Region. If your default region is set to \fBus\-east\-1\fP, you can omit the \fBregion\fP parameter.

The output includes all the operations that return an operation ID and that you have performed on all the domains that you have ever registered using the current AWS account. If you want to get only the operations that you submitted after a specified date, you can include the \fBsubmitted\-since\fP parameter and specify a date in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The following command gets the status of all operations that were submitted after 12:00 am UTC on January 1, 2020.

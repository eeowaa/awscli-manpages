.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created in a specified hosted zone.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
After you submit a \fBCreateTrafficPolicyInstance\fP or an \fBUpdateTrafficPolicyInstance\fP request, there\(aqs a brief delay while Amazon Route 53 creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traffic policy definition. For more information, see the \fBState\fP response element.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of traffic policy instances, you can use the \fBMaxItems\fP parameter to list them in groups of up to 100.
.sp

\fB\-\-traffic\-policy\-instance\-name\-marker\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the value of \fBIsTruncated\fP in the previous response is true, you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another \fBListTrafficPolicyInstances\fP request. For the value of \fBtrafficpolicyinstancename\fP , specify the value of \fBTrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker\fP from the previous response, which is the name of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traffic policy instances.
.sp
If the value of \fBIsTruncated\fP in the previous response was \fBfalse\fP , there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of traffic policy instances to be included in the response body for this request. If you have more than \fBMaxItems\fP traffic policy instances, the value of the \fBIsTruncated\fP element in the response is \fBtrue\fP , and the values of \fBHostedZoneIdMarker\fP , \fBTrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker\fP , and \fBTrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker\fP represent the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

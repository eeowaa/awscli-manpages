.SH NAME
proton-delete-environment-account-connection \- In an environment account, delete an environment account connection
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
In an environment account, delete an environment account connection.
.sp
After you delete an environment account connection that’s in use by an AWS Proton environment, AWS Proton \fIcan’t\fP manage the environment infrastructure resources until a new environment account connection is accepted for the environment account and associated environment. You\(aqre responsible for cleaning up provisioned resources that remain without an environment connection.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Environment account connections\fP in the \fIAWS Proton Administration guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

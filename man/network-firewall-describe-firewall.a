.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The descriptive name of the firewall. You can\(aqt change the name of a firewall after you create it.
.sp
You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
UpdateToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request.
.sp
To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it.
.sp
To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn\(aqt changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an \fBInvalidTokenException\fP . If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.
.UNINDENT

DeleteProtection \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A setting of \fBTRUE\fP indicates that the firewall is protected against deletion.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Tags \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource.
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case\-sensitive.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

FirewallStatus \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Detailed information about the current status of a  Firewall . You can retrieve this for a firewall by calling  DescribeFirewall and providing the firewall name and ARN.
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The readiness of the configured firewall to handle network traffic across all of the Availability Zones where you\(aqve configured it. This setting is \fBREADY\fP only when the \fBConfigurationSyncStateSummary\fP value is \fBIN_SYNC\fP and the \fBAttachment\fP  \fBStatus\fP values for all of the configured subnets are \fBREADY\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ConfigurationSyncStateSummary \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The configuration sync state for the firewall. This summarizes the sync states reported in the \fBConfig\fP settings for all of the Availability Zones where you have configured the firewall.
.sp
When you create a firewall or update its configuration, for example by adding a rule group to its firewall policy, Network Firewall distributes the configuration changes to all zones where the firewall is in use. This summary indicates whether the configuration changes have been applied everywhere.
.sp
This status must be \fBIN_SYNC\fP for the firewall to be ready for use, but it doesn\(aqt indicate that the firewall is ready. The \fBStatus\fP setting indicates firewall readiness.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SyncStates \-> (map)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The subnets that you\(aqve configured for use by the Network Firewall firewall. This contains one array element per Availability Zone where you\(aqve configured a subnet. These objects provide details of the information that is summarized in the \fBConfigurationSyncStateSummary\fP and \fBStatus\fP , broken down by zone and configuration object.
.sp
key \-> (string)
.sp
value \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy configuration for a single VPC subnet.
.sp
For each VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, AWS Network Firewall does the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the subnet, ready to take traffic.
.IP \(bu 2
Configures the endpoint with the current firewall policy settings, to provide the filtering behavior for the endpoint.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When you update a firewall, for example to add a subnet association or change a rule group in the firewall policy, the affected sync states reflect out\-of\-sync or not ready status until the changes are complete.
.sp
Attachment \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The attachment status of the firewall\(aqs association with a single VPC subnet. For each configured subnet, Network Firewall creates the attachment by instantiating the firewall endpoint in the subnet so that it\(aqs ready to take traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .
.sp
SubnetId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier of the subnet that you\(aqve specified to be used for a firewall endpoint.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EndpointId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier of the firewall endpoint that Network Firewall has instantiated in the subnet. You use this to identify the firewall endpoint in the VPC route tables, when you redirect the VPC traffic through the endpoint.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The current status of the firewall endpoint in the subnet. This value reflects both the instantiation of the endpoint in the VPC subnet and the sync states that are reported in the \fBConfig\fP settings. When this value is \fBREADY\fP , the endpoint is available and configured properly to handle network traffic. When the endpoint isn\(aqt available for traffic, this value will reflect its state, for example \fBCREATING\fP , \fBDELETING\fP , or \fBFAILED\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Config \-> (map)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The configuration status of the firewall endpoint in a single VPC subnet. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .
.sp
key \-> (string)
.sp
value \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Provides configuration status for a single policy or rule group that is used for a firewall endpoint. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of a  SyncState for a firewall.
.sp
SyncStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether this object is in sync with the version indicated in the update token.
.UNINDENT

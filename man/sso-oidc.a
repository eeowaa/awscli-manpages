.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
AWS Single Sign\-On (SSO) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to register with AWS SSO. The service also enables the client to fetch the userâ€™s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with AWS SSO. This service conforms with the OAuth 2.0 based implementation of the device authorization grant standard (\fI\%https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628\fP ).

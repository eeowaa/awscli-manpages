.SH NAME
logs-put-subscription-filter \- Creates or updates a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log group
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates or updates a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log group. Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a real\-time stream of log events ingested through \fI\%PutLogEvents\fP and have them delivered to a specific destination. When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the gzip format.
.sp
The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same\-account delivery.
.IP \(bu 2
A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for cross\-account delivery.
.IP \(bu 2
An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same\-account delivery.
.IP \(bu 2
An AWS Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same\-account delivery.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each log group can have up to two subscription filters associated with it. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in \fBfilterName\fP .
.sp
To perform a \fBPutSubscriptionFilter\fP operation, you must also have the \fBiam:PassRole\fP permission.
.sp

\fB\-\-log\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the log group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-filter\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A name for the subscription filter. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in \fBfilterName\fP . To find the name of the filter currently associated with a log group, use \fI\%DescribeSubscriptionFilters\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-filter\-pattern\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events.

.sp
\fB\-\-destination\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the destination to deliver matching log events to. Currently, the supported destinations are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same\-account delivery.
.IP \(bu 2
A logical destination (specified using an ARN) belonging to a different account, for cross\-account delivery. If you are setting up a cross\-account subscription, the destination must have an IAM policy associated with it that allows the sender to send logs to the destination. For more information, see \fI\%PutDestinationPolicy\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same\-account delivery.
.IP \(bu 2
An AWS Lambda function belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same\-account delivery.

.sp
\fB\-\-role\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination stream. You don\(aqt need to provide the ARN when you are working with a logical destination for cross\-account delivery.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-distribution\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The method used to distribute log data to the destination. By default, log data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to random for a more even distribution. This property is only applicable when the destination is an Amazon Kinesis stream.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

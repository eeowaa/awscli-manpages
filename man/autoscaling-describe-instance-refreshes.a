autoscaling-describe-instance-refreshes \- Describes one or more instance refreshes
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes one or more instance refreshes.
.sp
You can determine the status of a request by looking at the \fBStatus\fP parameter. The following are the possible statuses:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPending\fP \- The request was created, but the operation has not started.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBInProgress\fP \- The operation is in progress.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSuccessful\fP \- The operation completed successfully.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFailed\fP \- The operation failed to complete. You can troubleshoot using the status reason and the scaling activities.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCancelling\fP \- An ongoing operation is being cancelled. Cancellation does not roll back any replacements that have already been completed, but it prevents new replacements from being started.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCancelled\fP \- The operation is cancelled.

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-records\fP (integer)

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
cloudfront-create-origin-request-policy \- Creates an origin request policy
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an origin request policy.
.sp
After you create an origin request policy, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors. When it’s attached to a cache behavior, the origin request policy determines the values that CloudFront includes in requests that it sends to the origin. Each request that CloudFront sends to the origin includes the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The request body and the URL path (without the domain name) from the viewer request.
.IP \(bu 2
The headers that CloudFront automatically includes in every origin request, including \fBHost\fP , \fBUser\-Agent\fP , and \fBX\-Amz\-Cf\-Id\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
All HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings that are specified in the cache policy or the origin request policy. These can include items from the viewer request and, in the case of headers, additional ones that are added by CloudFront.
.UNINDENT
.sp
CloudFront sends a request when it can’t find a valid object in its cache that matches the request. If you want to send values to the origin and also include them in the cache key, use \fBCachePolicy\fP .
.sp
For more information about origin request policies, see \fI\%Controlling origin requests\fP in the \fIAmazon CloudFront Developer Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Changes the state of a file transfer protocol\-enabled server from \fBONLINE\fP to \fBOFFLINE\fP . An \fBOFFLINE\fP server cannot accept and process file transfer jobs. Information tied to your server, such as server and user properties, are not affected by stopping your server.
.sp

The state of \fBSTOPPING\fP indicates that the server is in an intermediate state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully offline. The values of \fBSTOP_FAILED\fP can indicate an error condition.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

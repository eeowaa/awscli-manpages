.sp
\fB\-\-application\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the application. This identifier is displayed as the \fBProject ID\fP on the Amazon Pinpoint console.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-campaign\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier for the campaign.

.sp
\fB\-\-end\-time\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The last date and time to retrieve data for, as part of an inclusive date range that filters the query results. This value should be in extended ISO 8601 format and use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), for example: 2019\-07\-26T20:00:00Z for 8:00 PM UTC July 26, 2019.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-kpi\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the metric, also referred to as a \fIkey performance indicator (KPI)\fP , to retrieve data for. This value describes the associated metric and consists of two or more terms, which are comprised of lowercase alphanumeric characters, separated by a hyphen. Examples are email\-open\-rate and successful\-delivery\-rate. For a list of valid values, see the \fI\%Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The string that specifies which page of results to return in a paginated response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign, and journey metrics.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of items to include in each page of a paginated response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign, and journey metrics.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-start\-time\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The first date and time to retrieve data for, as part of an inclusive date range that filters the query results. This value should be in extended ISO 8601 format and use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), for example: 2019\-07\-19T20:00:00Z for 8:00 PM UTC July 19, 2019. This value should also be fewer than 90 days from the current day.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

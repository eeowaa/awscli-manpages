.SH NAME
secretsmanager-put-resource-policy \- Attaches the contents of the specified resource-based permission policy to a secret
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Attaches the contents of the specified resource\-based permission policy to a secret. A resource\-based policy is optional. Alternatively, you can use IAM identity\-based policies that specify the secret\(aqs Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the policy statement\(aqs \fBResources\fP element. You can also use a combination of both identity\-based and resource\-based policies. The affected users and roles receive the permissions that are permitted by all of the relevant policies. For more information, see \fI\%Using Resource\-Based Policies for AWS Secrets Manager\fP . For the complete description of the AWS policy syntax and grammar, see \fI\%IAM JSON Policy Reference\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-secret\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the secret that you want to attach the resource\-based policy. You can specify either the ARN or the friendly name of the secret.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
.sp
If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the \(aqfriendly name\(aq, you \fImust\fP not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a \fIResourceNotFoundException\fP or an \fIAccessDeniedException\fP error, depending on your permissions.

\fB\-\-resource\-policy\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A JSON\-formatted string constructed according to the grammar and syntax for an AWS resource\-based policy. The policy in the string identifies who can access or manage this secret and its versions. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see \fI\%Using JSON for Parameters\fP in the \fIAWS CLI User Guide\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) If you set the parameter, \fBBlockPublicPolicy\fP to true, then you block resource\-based policies that allow broad access to the secret.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBTo add a resource\-based policy to a secret\fP
.sp
The following example shows how to add a resource\-based policy to a secret. The policy is read from a file on disk and must contain a valid JSON policy document. For more information, see \fIResource\-based Policies\fP in the \fISecrets Manager User Guide\fP\&.

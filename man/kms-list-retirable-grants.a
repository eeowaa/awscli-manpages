.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns all grants in which the specified principal is the \fBRetiringPrincipal\fP in the grant.
.sp
You can specify any principal in your AWS account. The grants that are returned include grants for CMKs in your AWS account and other AWS accounts.
.sp
You might use this operation to determine which grants you may retire. To retire a grant, use the  RetireGrant operation.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBCross\-account use\fP : You must specify a principal in your AWS account. However, this operation can return grants in any AWS account. You do not need \fBkms:ListRetirableGrants\fP permission (or any other additional permission) in any AWS account other than your own.
.sp
\fBRequired permissions\fP : \fI\%kms:ListRetirableGrants\fP (IAM policy) in your AWS account.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-limit\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this parameter to specify the maximum number of items to return. When this value is present, AWS KMS does not return more than the specified number of items, but it might return fewer.
.sp
This value is optional. If you include a value, it must be between 1 and 100, inclusive. If you do not include a value, it defaults to 50.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-marker\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this parameter in a subsequent request after you receive a response with truncated results. Set it to the value of \fBNextMarker\fP from the truncated response you just received.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-retiring\-principal\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The retiring principal for which to list grants. Enter a principal in your AWS account.
.sp
To specify the retiring principal, use the \fI\%Amazon Resource Name (ARN)\fP of an AWS principal. Valid AWS principals include AWS accounts (root), IAM users, federated users, and assumed role users. For examples of the ARN syntax for specifying a principal, see \fI\%AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\fP in the Example ARNs section of the \fIAmazon Web Services General Reference\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo view the grants that a principal can retire\fP
.sp
The following \fBlist\-retirable\-grants\fP example displays all of the grants that the \fBExampleAdmin\fP user can retire on the customer master keys (CMKs) in an AWS account and Region. You can use a command like this one to view the grants that any account principal can retire on CMKs in the AWS account and Region.
.sp
The value of the required \fBretiring\-principal\fP parameter must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an account, user, or role.
.sp
You cannot specify a service for the value of \fBretiring\-principal\fP in this command, even though a service can be the retiring principal. To find the grants in which a particular service is the retiring principal, use the \fBlist\-grants\fP command.
.sp
The output shows that \fBExampleAdmin\fP user has permission to retire grants on two different CMKs in the account and region. In addition to the retiring principal, the account (root) has permission to retire any grant in the account.

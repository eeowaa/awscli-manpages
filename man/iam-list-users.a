.SH NAME
iam-list-users \- Lists the IAM users that have the specified path prefix
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists the IAM users that have the specified path prefix. If no path prefix is specified, the operation returns all users in the AWS account. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list.

IAM resource\-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a user, see  GetUser .

.sp
You can paginate the results using the \fBMaxItems\fP and \fBMarker\fP parameters.

\fBlist\-users\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBUsers\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-path\-prefix\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path prefix for filtering the results. For example: \fB/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/\fP , which would get all user names whose path starts with \fB/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/\fP .
.sp
This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all user names. This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\fB\eu0021\fP ) through the DEL character (\fB\eu007F\fP ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Arn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
CreateDate \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
PasswordLastUsed \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The date and time, in \fI\%ISO 8601 date\-time format\fP , when the user\(aqs password was last used to sign in to an AWS website. For a list of AWS websites that capture a user\(aqs last sign\-in time, see the \fI\%Credential reports\fP topic in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . If a password is used more than once in a five\-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The user never had a password.
.IP \(bu 2
A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A null value does not mean that the user \fInever\fP had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.
.sp
This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations.

.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

AWS always interprets the tag \fBValue\fP as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma\-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

IsTruncated \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the \fBMarker\fP request parameter to retrieve more items.

We recommend that you check \fBIsTruncated\fP after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

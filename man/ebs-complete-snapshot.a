.SH NAME
ebs-complete-snapshot \- Seals and completes the snapshot after all of the required blocks of data have been written to it
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Seals and completes the snapshot after all of the required blocks of data have been written to it. Completing the snapshot changes the status to \fBcompleted\fP . You cannot write new blocks to a snapshot after it has been completed.

.sp
\fB\-\-snapshot\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the snapshot.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-changed\-blocks\-count\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of blocks that were written to the snapshot.

.sp
\fB\-\-checksum\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An aggregated Base\-64 SHA256 checksum based on the checksums of each written block.
.sp
To generate the aggregated checksum using the linear aggregation method, arrange the checksums for each written block in ascending order of their block index, concatenate them to form a single string, and then generate the checksum on the entire string using the SHA256 algorithm.

\fB\-\-checksum\-algorithm\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The algorithm used to generate the checksum. Currently, the only supported algorithm is \fBSHA256\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

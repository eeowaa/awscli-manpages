.SH NAME
glacier-complete-vault-lock \- This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from the InProgress state to the Locked state, which causes the vault lock policy to become unchangeable
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from the \fBInProgress\fP state to the \fBLocked\fP state, which causes the vault lock policy to become unchangeable. A vault lock is put into the \fBInProgress\fP state by calling  InitiateVaultLock . You can obtain the state of the vault lock by calling  GetVaultLock . For more information about the vault locking process, \fI\%Amazon Glacier Vault Lock\fP .
.sp
This operation is idempotent. This request is always successful if the vault lock is in the \fBLocked\fP state and the provided lock ID matches the lock ID originally used to lock the vault.
.sp
If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the \fBLocked\fP state, the operation returns an \fBAccessDeniedException\fP error. If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the \fBInProgress\fP state, the operation throws an \fBInvalidParameter\fP error.

\fB\-\-account\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBAccountId\fP value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single \(aq\fB\-\fP \(aq (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens (\(aq\-\(aq) in the ID.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo complete an in\-progress vault lock process\fP
.sp
The following \fBcomplete\-vault\-lock\fP example completes the in\-progress locking progress for the specified vault and sets the lock state of the vault lock to \fBLocked\fP\&. You get the value for the \fBlock\-id\fP parameter when you run \fBinitiate\-lock\-process\fP\&.

When you use your backup application to eject the tape, the tape is archived directly into the S3 storage class (S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for archiving. The tape in this pool is archived in the S3 storage class that is associated with the pool.

.INDENT 3.5
Set permissions to bypass governance retention. If the lock type of the archived tape is \fBGovernance\fP , the tape\(aqs archived age is not older than \fBRetentionLockInDays\fP , and the user does not already have \fBBypassGovernanceRetention\fP , setting this to TRUE enables the user to bypass the retention lock. This parameter is set to true by default for calls from the console.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

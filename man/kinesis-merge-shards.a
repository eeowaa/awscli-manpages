kinesis-merge-shards \- Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single shard to reduce the stream(aqs capacity to ingest and transport data
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single shard to reduce the stream\(aqs capacity to ingest and transport data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key range of 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent shards.

\fBMergeShards\fP is called when there is a need to reduce the overall capacity of a stream because of excess capacity that is not being used. You must specify the shard to be merged and the adjacent shard for a stream. For more information about merging shards, see \fI\%Merge Two Shards\fP in the \fIAmazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide\fP .

.sp
If the stream is in the \fBACTIVE\fP state, you can call \fBMergeShards\fP . If a stream is in the \fBCREATING\fP , \fBUPDATING\fP , or \fBDELETING\fP state, \fBMergeShards\fP returns a \fBResourceInUseException\fP . If the specified stream does not exist, \fBMergeShards\fP returns a \fBResourceNotFoundException\fP .
.sp
You can use  DescribeStream to check the state of the stream, which is returned in \fBStreamStatus\fP .

\fBMergeShards\fP is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a \fBMergeShards\fP request, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets the \fBStreamStatus\fP to \fBUPDATING\fP . After the operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the \fBStreamStatus\fP to \fBACTIVE\fP . Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the \fBUPDATING\fP state.

.sp
You use  DescribeStream to determine the shard IDs that are specified in the \fBMergeShards\fP request.
.sp
If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using  CreateStream ,  DeleteStream , \fBMergeShards\fP , or  SplitShard , you receive a \fBLimitExceededException\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

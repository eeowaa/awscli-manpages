.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This action gets a bucket policy for an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To get a policy for an S3 bucket, see \fI\%GetBucketPolicy\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 API Reference\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Returns the policy of a specified Outposts bucket. For more information, see \fI\%Using Amazon S3 on Outposts\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the \fBGetBucketPolicy\fP permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner\(aqs account in order to use this action.
.sp
Only users from Outposts bucket owner account with the right permissions can perform actions on an Outposts bucket. If you don\(aqt have \fBs3\-outposts:GetBucketPolicy\fP permissions or you\(aqre not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner\(aqs account, Amazon S3 returns a \fB403 Access Denied\fP error.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of \fBx\-amz\-outpost\-id\fP to be passed with the request and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of \fBs3\-control\fP . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the \fBx\-amz\-outpost\-id\fP derived using the access point ARN, see the \fI\%Examples\fP section.

.sp
For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the AWS SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format \fBarn:aws:s3\-outposts:<Region>:<account\-id>:outpost/<outpost\-id>/bucket/<my\-bucket\-name>\fP . For example, to access the bucket \fBreports\fP through outpost \fBmy\-outpost\fP owned by account \fB123456789012\fP in Region \fBus\-west\-2\fP , use the URL encoding of \fBarn:aws:s3\-outposts:us\-west\-2:123456789012:outpost/my\-outpost/bucket/reports\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

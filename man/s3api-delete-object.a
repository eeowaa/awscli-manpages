.SH NAME
s3api-delete-object \- Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn\(aqt a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will still respond that the command was successful.
.sp
To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, \fBx\-amz\-delete\-marker\fP , to true.
.sp
If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the \fBx\-amz\-mfa\fP request header in the DELETE \fBversionId\fP request. Requests that include \fBx\-amz\-mfa\fP must use HTTPS.
.sp
For more information about MFA Delete, see \fI\%Using MFA Delete\fP . To see sample requests that use versioning, see \fI\%Sample Request\fP .
.sp
You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure its lifecycle (\fI\%PutBucketLifecycle\fP ) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the \fBs3:DeleteObject\fP , \fBs3:DeleteObjectVersion\fP , and \fBs3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration\fP actions.

.sp
\fB\-\-bucket\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The bucket name of the bucket containing the object.
.sp
When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .s3\-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \fI\%Using access points\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .*outpostID* .s3\-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \fI\%Using S3 on Outposts\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-request\-payer\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. For information about downloading objects from requester pays buckets, see \fI\%Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-bypass\-governance\-retention\fP | \fB\-\-no\-bypass\-governance\-retention\fP (boolean)

\fB\-\-expected\-bucket\-owner\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

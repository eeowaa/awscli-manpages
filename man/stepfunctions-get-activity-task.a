.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN) which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine. This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a task of this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns a \fBtaskToken\fP with a null string.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 65 seconds (5 seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold the poll request).
.sp
Polling with \fBGetActivityTask\fP can cause latency in some implementations. See \fI\%Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks\fP in the Step Functions Developer Guide.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-activity\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the activity to retrieve tasks from (assigned when you create the task using  CreateActivity .)
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-worker\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You can provide an arbitrary name in order to identify the worker that the task is assigned to. This name is used when it is logged in the execution history.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
taskToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token that identifies the scheduled task. This token must be copied and included in subsequent calls to  SendTaskHeartbeat ,  SendTaskSuccess or  SendTaskFailure in order to report the progress or completion of the task.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
input \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The string that contains the JSON input data for the task. Length constraints apply to the payload size, and are expressed as bytes in UTF\-8 encoding.

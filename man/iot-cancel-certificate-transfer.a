.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Cancels a pending transfer for the specified certificate.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBNote\fP Only the transfer source account can use this operation to cancel a transfer. (Transfer destinations can use  RejectCertificateTransfer instead.) After transfer, AWS IoT returns the certificate to the source account in the INACTIVE state. After the destination account has accepted the transfer, the transfer cannot be cancelled.

After a certificate transfer is cancelled, the status of the certificate changes from PENDING_TRANSFER to INACTIVE.

The ID of the certificate. (The last part of the certificate ARN contains the certificate ID.)

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

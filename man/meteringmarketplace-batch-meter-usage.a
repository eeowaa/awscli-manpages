meteringmarketplace-batch-meter-usage \- BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers.
.sp
For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried with the same records or a subset of the input records.
.sp
Every request to BatchMeterUsage is for one product. If you need to meter usage for multiple products, you must make multiple calls to BatchMeterUsage.
.sp
BatchMeterUsage can process up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.
.sp
A UsageRecord can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to provide customers with usagedata split into buckets by tags that you define (or allow the customer to define).
.sp
BatchMeterUsage requests must be less than 1MB in size.
.sp

A UsageRecord indicates a quantity of usage for a given product, customer, dimension and time.
.sp
Multiple requests with the same UsageRecords as input will be deduplicated to prevent double charges.
.sp
Timestamp \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Timestamp, in UTC, for which the usage is being reported.
.sp
Your application can meter usage for up to one hour in the past. Make sure the timestamp value is not before the start of the software usage.

\fB\-\-product\-code\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Adds persistence of state for the user session in an embedded dashboard. Persistence applies to the sheet and the parameter settings. These are control settings that the dashboard subscriber (QuickSight reader) chooses while viewing the dashboard. If this is set to \fBTRUE\fP , the settings are the same when the subscriber reopens the same dashboard URL. The state is stored in QuickSight, not in a browser cookie. If this is set to FALSE, the state of the user session is not persisted. The default is \fBFALSE\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-user\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon QuickSight user\(aqs Amazon Resource Name (ARN), for use with \fBQUICKSIGHT\fP identity type. You can use this for any Amazon QuickSight users in your account (readers, authors, or admins) authenticated as one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Active Directory (AD) users or group members
.IP \(bu 2
Invited nonfederated users
.IP \(bu 2
IAM users and IAM role\-based sessions authenticated through Federated Single Sign\-On using SAML, OpenID Connect, or IAM federation.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Omit this parameter for users in the third group â€“ IAM users and IAM role\-based sessions.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-namespace\fP (string)

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-additional\-dashboard\-ids\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of one or more dashboard IDs that you want to add to a session that includes anonymous users. The \fBIdentityType\fP parameter must be set to \fBANONYMOUS\fP for this to work, because other identity types authenticate as QuickSight or IAM users. For example, if you set "\fB\-\-dashboard\-id dash_id1 \-\-dashboard\-id dash_id2 dash_id3 identity\-type ANONYMOUS\fP ", the session can access all three dashboards.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-instance\-profile\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the IAM instance profile whose tags you want to see.
.sp
This parameter accepts (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters that consist of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@\-

.sp
\fB\-\-marker\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the \fBMarker\fP element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items that you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum that you specify, the \fBIsTruncated\fP response element is \fBtrue\fP .
.sp
If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when more results are available. In that case, the \fBIsTruncated\fP response element returns \fBtrue\fP , and \fBMarker\fP contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Tags \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of tags that are currently attached to the IAM instance profile. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. If no tags are attached to the specified resource, the response contains an empty list.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that represents user\-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, \fBDepartment\fP or \fBCost Center\fP are common choices.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of \fBDepartment\fP could have values such as \fBHuman Resources\fP , \fBAccounting\fP , and \fBSupport\fP . Tags with a key name of \fBCost Center\fP might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AWS always interprets the tag \fBValue\fP as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma\-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

IsTruncated \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can use the \fBMarker\fP request parameter to make a subsequent pagination request that retrieves more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the \fBMaxItems\fP number of results even when more results are available. Check \fBIsTruncated\fP after every call to ensure that you receive all of your results.

Marker \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When \fBIsTruncated\fP is \fBtrue\fP , this element is present and contains the value to use for the \fBMarker\fP parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

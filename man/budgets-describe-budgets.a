\fBdescribe\-budgets\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBBudgets\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-account\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBaccountId\fP that is associated with the budgets that you want descriptions of.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
BudgetName \-> (string)

.sp
BudgetLimit \-> (structure)

.INDENT 3.5
The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBBudgetLimit\fP is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets default to \fB100\fP , which is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can\(aqt use \fBBudgetLimit\fP with \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP for \fBCreateBudget\fP and \fBUpdateBudget\fP actions.

\fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly and quarterly \fBTimeUnit\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The \fBkey\fP is the start of the month, \fBUTC\fP in epoch seconds.
.sp
For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The \fBkey\fP is the start of the quarter, \fBUTC\fP in epoch seconds.
.sp
If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly, provide the \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP values only for the remaining periods.
.sp
If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP values from the start date of the budget.
.sp
After all of the \fBBudgetLimit\fP values in \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the \fBBudgetLimit\fP . At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBDescribeBudget\fP and \fBDescribeBudgets\fP response along with \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP will also contain \fBBudgetLimit\fP representing the current month or quarter limit present in \fBPlannedBudgetLimits\fP .

If you create your budget and don\(aqt specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY).

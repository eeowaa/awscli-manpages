.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. You must call the \fBGetFederationToken\fP operation using the long\-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server\-based application. For a comparison of \fBGetFederationToken\fP with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see \fI\%Requesting Temporary Security Credentials\fP and \fI\%Comparing the AWS STS API operations\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

You can create a mobile\-based or browser\-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect\-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use \fI\%Amazon Cognito\fP or \fBAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\fP . For more information, see \fI\%Federation Through a Web\-based Identity Provider\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.sp
You can also call \fBGetFederationToken\fP using the security credentials of an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see \fI\%IAM Best Practices\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.sp
The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).

You can use the temporary credentials created by \fBGetFederationToken\fP in any AWS service except the following:

You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API.
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot call any STS operations except \fBGetCallerIdentity\fP .

.sp
You must pass an inline or managed \fI\%session policy\fP to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can\(aqt exceed 2,048 characters.
.sp
Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see \fI\%Session Policies\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . For information about using \fBGetFederationToken\fP to create temporary security credentials, see \fI\%GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker\fP .
.sp
You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource\-based policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the \fBPrincipal\fP element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.

For more information, see \fI\%Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute\-Based Access Control\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate \fBDepartment\fP and \fBdepartment\fP tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the \fBDepartment\fP =\(ga\(gaMarketing\(ga\(ga tag and you pass the \fBdepartment\fP =\(ga\(gaengineering\(ga\(ga session tag. \fBDepartment\fP and \fBdepartment\fP are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.

Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.

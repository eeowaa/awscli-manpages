.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns the deployments for your Amazon Lightsail container service
.sp
A deployment specifies the settings, such as the ports and launch command, of containers that are deployed to your container service.
.sp
The deployments are ordered by version in ascending order. The newest version is listed at the top of the response.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A set number of deployments are kept before the oldest one is replaced with the newest one. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon Lightsail endpoints and quotas\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-service\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the container service for which to return deployments.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.IP \(bu 2
\fBInactive\fP \- The deployment was previously successfully created, but it is not currently running on the container service.
.IP \(bu 2

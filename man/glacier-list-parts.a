.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in a specific multipart upload. You can make this request at any time during an in\-progress multipart upload before you complete the upload (see  CompleteMultipartUpload . List Parts returns an error for completed uploads. The list returned in the List Parts response is sorted by part range.
.sp
The List Parts operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 50 uploaded parts in the response. You should always check the response for a \fBmarker\fP at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the \fBmarker\fP is \fBnull\fP . To return a list of parts that begins at a specific part, set the \fBmarker\fP request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Parts request. You can also limit the number of parts returned in the response by specifying the \fBlimit\fP parameter in the request.
.sp
An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\(aqt have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see \fI\%Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\fP .
.sp
For conceptual information and the underlying REST API, see \fI\%Working with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier\fP and \fI\%List Parts\fP in the \fIAmazon Glacier Developer Guide\fP .

\fBlist\-parts\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBParts\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-account\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBAccountId\fP value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single \(aq\fB\-\fP \(aq (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens (\(aq\-\(aq) in the ID.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-vault\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the vault.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-upload\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The upload ID of the multipart upload.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Used by administrators to choose which groups in the directory should have access to upload and download files over the enabled protocols using AWS Transfer Family. For example, a Microsoft Active Directory might contain 50,000 users, but only a small fraction might need the ability to transfer files to the server. An administrator can use \fBCreateAccess\fP to limit the access to the correct set of users who need this ability.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-home\-directory\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client.
.sp
A \fBHomeDirectory\fP example is \fB/directory_name/home/mydirectory\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-home\-directory\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users\(aq home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to \fBPATH\fP , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it \fBLOGICAL\fP , you must provide mappings in the \fBHomeDirectoryMappings\fP for how you want to make Amazon S3 paths visible to your users.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPATH\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBLOGICAL\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-home\-directory\-mappings\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the \fBEntry\fP and \fBTarget\fP pair, where \fBEntry\fP shows how the path is made visible and \fBTarget\fP is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You also must ensure that your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in \fBTarget\fP . This value can only be set when \fBHomeDirectoryType\fP is set to \fILOGICAL\fP .
.sp
The following is an \fBEntry\fP and \fBTarget\fP pair example.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB[ { "Entry": "your\-personal\-report.pdf", "Target": "/bucket3/customized\-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf" } ]\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope\-down policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("\fBchroot\fP "). To do this, you can set \fBEntry\fP to \fB/\fP and set \fBTarget\fP to the \fBHomeDirectory\fP parameter value.
.sp
The following is an \fBEntry\fP and \fBTarget\fP pair example for \fBchroot\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB[ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0\-byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the AWS CLI, use the \fBs3api\fP or \fBefsapi\fP call instead of \fBs3\fP or \fBefs\fP so you can use the \fBput\-object\fP operation. For example, you can use the following.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBaws s3api put\-object \-\-bucket bucketname \-\-key path/to/folder/\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The end of the key name must end in a \fB/\fP for it to be considered a folder.

\fB\-\-policy\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A scope\-down policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include \fB${Transfer:UserName}\fP , \fB${Transfer:HomeDirectory}\fP , and \fB${Transfer:HomeBucket}\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This only applies when domain of \fBServerId\fP is S3. Amazon EFS does not use scope down policy.
.sp
For scope\-down policies, AWS Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the \fBPolicy\fP argument.
.sp
For an example of a scope\-down policy, see \fI\%Example scope\-down policy\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
The full POSIX identity, including user ID (\fBUid\fP ), group ID (\fBGid\fP ), and any secondary groups IDs (\fBSecondaryGids\fP ), that controls your users\(aq access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

\fB\-\-role\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the IAM role that controls your users\(aq access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users\(aq transfer requests.

\fB\-\-server\-id\fP (string)

A system\-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the specific server that you added your user to.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-external\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using AWS Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBGet\-ADGroup \-Filter {samAccountName \-like "*YourGroupName* *"} \-Properties * | Select SamaccountName,ObjectSid\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In that command, replace \fIYourGroupName\fP with the name of your Active Directory group.
.sp
The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/\-
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

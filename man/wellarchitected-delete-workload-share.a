.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique case\-sensitive string used to ensure that this request is idempotent (executes only once).
.sp
You should not reuse the same token for other requests. If you retry a request with the same client request token and the same parameters after it has completed successfully, the result of the original request is returned.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This token is listed as required, however, if you do not specify it, the AWS SDKs automatically generate one for you. If you are not using the AWS SDK or the AWS CLI, you must provide this token or the request will fail.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

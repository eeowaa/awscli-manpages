.SH NAME
secretsmanager-update-secret-version-stage \- Modifies the staging labels attached to a version of a secret
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Modifies the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Staging labels are used to track a version as it progresses through the secret rotation process. You can attach a staging label to only one version of a secret at a time. If a staging label to be added is already attached to another version, then it is moved\-\-removed from the other version first and then attached to this one. For more information about staging labels, see \fI\%Staging Labels\fP in the \fIAWS Secrets Manager User Guide\fP .
.sp
The staging labels that you specify in the \fBVersionStage\fP parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels\-\-they don\(aqt replace it.
.sp
You can move the \fBAWSCURRENT\fP staging label to this version by including it in this call.
.sp

Whenever you move \fBAWSCURRENT\fP , Secrets Manager automatically moves the label \fBAWSPREVIOUS\fP to the version that \fBAWSCURRENT\fP was removed from.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be \(aqdeprecated\(aq and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-secret\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the secret with the version with the list of staging labels you want to modify. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
.sp
If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the \(aqfriendly name\(aq, you \fImust\fP not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a \fIResourceNotFoundException\fP or an \fIAccessDeniedException\fP error, depending on your permissions.

\fB\-\-version\-stage\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The staging label to add to this version.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-remove\-from\-version\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the secret version ID of the version that the staging label is to be removed from. If the staging label you are trying to attach to one version is already attached to a different version, then you must include this parameter and specify the version that the label is to be removed from. If the label is attached and you either do not specify this parameter, or the version ID does not match, then the operation fails.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-move\-to\-version\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) The secret version ID that you want to add the staging label. If you want to remove a label from a version, then do not specify this parameter.
.sp
If the staging label is already attached to a different version of the secret, then you must also specify the \fBRemoveFromVersionId\fP parameter.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

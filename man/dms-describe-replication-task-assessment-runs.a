.sp
\fB\-\-filters\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Filters applied to the premigration assessment runs described in the form of key\-value pairs.
.sp
Valid filter names: \fBreplication\-task\-assessment\-run\-arn\fP , \fBreplication\-task\-arn\fP , \fBreplication\-instance\-arn\fP , \fBstatus\fP
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is used to limit the number and type of AWS DMS objects that are returned for a particular \fBDescribe*\fP call or similar operation. Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API operations.
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the filter as specified for a \fBDescribe*\fP or similar operation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Values \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The filter value, which can specify one or more values used to narrow the returned results.

\fB\-\-max\-records\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified \fBMaxRecords\fP value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-marker\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by \fBMaxRecords\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Marker \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent request. If you pass this token as the \fBMarker\fP value in a subsequent request, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified in the request by \fBMaxRecords\fP .

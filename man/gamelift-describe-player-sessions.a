.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions.
.sp
This action can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To retrieve a specific player session, provide the player session ID only.
.IP \(bu 2
To retrieve all player sessions in a game session, provide the game session ID only.
.IP \(bu 2
To retrieve all player sessions for a specific player, provide a player ID only.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To request player sessions, specify either a player session ID, game session ID, or player ID. You can filter this request by player session status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
.sp
If successful, a \fBPlayerSession\fP object is returned for each session that matches the request.

\fBdescribe\-player\-sessions\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBPlayerSessions\fP

.INDENT 3.5
Player session status to filter results on.
.sp
Possible player session statuses include the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRESERVED\fP \-\- The player session request has been received, but the player has not yet connected to the server process and/or been validated.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACTIVE\fP \-\- The player has been validated by the server process and is currently connected.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCOMPLETED\fP \-\- The player connection has been dropped.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBTIMEDOUT\fP \-\- A player session request was received, but the player did not connect and/or was not validated within the timeout limit (60 seconds).

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
PlayerSessions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A collection of objects containing properties for each player session that matches the request.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents a player session. Player sessions are created either for a specific game session, or as part of a game session placement or matchmaking request. A player session can represents a reserved player slot in a game session (when status is \fBRESERVED\fP ) or actual player activity in a game session (when status is \fBACTIVE\fP ). A player session object, including player data, is automatically passed to a game session when the player connects to the game session and is validated. After the game session ends, player sessions information is retained for 30 days and then removed.

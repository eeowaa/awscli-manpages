.SH NAME
textract-detect-document-text \- Detects text in the input document
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Detects text in the input document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a line of text. The input document must be an image in JPEG or PNG format. \fBDetectDocumentText\fP returns the detected text in an array of  Block objects.
.sp
Each document page has as an associated \fBBlock\fP of type PAGE. Each PAGE \fBBlock\fP object is the parent of LINE \fBBlock\fP objects that represent the lines of detected text on a page. A LINE \fBBlock\fP object is a parent for each word that makes up the line. Words are represented by \fBBlock\fP objects of type WORD.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBDetectDocumentText\fP is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use  StartDocumentTextDetection .

.sp
\fB\-\-document\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The input document as base64\-encoded bytes or an Amazon S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, you can\(aqt pass image bytes. The document must be an image in JPEG or PNG format.
.sp
If you\(aqre using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might not need to base64\-encode image bytes that are passed using the \fBBytes\fP field.
.sp
Bytes \-> (blob)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A blob of base64\-encoded document bytes. The maximum size of a document that\(aqs provided in a blob of bytes is 5 MB. The document bytes must be in PNG or JPEG format.

If you\(aqre using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might not need to base64\-encode image bytes passed using the \fBBytes\fP field.

.sp
S3Object \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Identifies an S3 object as the document source. The maximum size of a document that\(aqs stored in an S3 bucket is 5 MB.
.sp
Bucket \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the S3 bucket.

.sp
Version \-> (string)

.INDENT 3.5
If the bucket has versioning enabled, you can specify the object version.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.INDENT 3.5
A \fBBlock\fP represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a \fBBlock\fP object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText ), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.
.sp
An array of \fBBlock\fP objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of \fBBlock\fP objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

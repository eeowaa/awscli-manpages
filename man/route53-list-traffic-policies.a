.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-traffic\-policy\-id\-marker\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Conditional) For your first request to \fBListTrafficPolicies\fP , don\(aqt include the \fBTrafficPolicyIdMarker\fP parameter.
.sp
If you have more traffic policies than the value of \fBMaxItems\fP , \fBListTrafficPolicies\fP returns only the first \fBMaxItems\fP traffic policies. To get the next group of policies, submit another request to \fBListTrafficPolicies\fP . For the value of \fBTrafficPolicyIdMarker\fP , specify the value of \fBTrafficPolicyIdMarker\fP that was returned in the previous response.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) The maximum number of traffic policies that you want Amazon Route 53 to return in response to this request. If you have more than \fBMaxItems\fP traffic policies, the value of \fBIsTruncated\fP in the response is \fBtrue\fP , and the value of \fBTrafficPolicyIdMarker\fP is the ID of the first traffic policy that Route 53 will return if you submit another request.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Given a data set type and data set publication date, asynchronously publishes the requested data set to the specified S3 bucket and notifies the specified SNS topic once the data is available. Returns a unique request identifier that can be used to correlate requests with notifications from the SNS topic. Data sets will be published in comma\-separated values (CSV) format with the file name {data_set_type}_YYYY\-MM\-DD.csv. If a file with the same name already exists (e.g. if the same data set is requested twice), the original file will be overwritten by the new file. Requires a Role with an attached permissions policy providing Allow permissions for the following actions: s3:PutObject, s3:GetBucketLocation, sns:GetTopicAttributes, sns:Publish, iam:GetRolePolicy.

\fB\-\-data\-set\-publication\-date\fP (timestamp)
The date a data set was published. For daily data sets, provide a date with day\-level granularity for the desired day. For monthly data sets except those with prefix disbursed_amount, provide a date with month\-level granularity for the desired month (the day value will be ignored). For data sets with prefix disbursed_amount, provide a date with day\-level granularity for the desired day. For these data sets we will look backwards in time over the range of 31 days until the first data set is found (the latest one).
.sp
\fB\-\-role\-name\-arn\fP (string)
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Role with an attached permissions policy to interact with the provided AWS services.
.sp
\fB\-\-destination\-s3\-bucket\-name\fP (string)
The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the destination S3 bucket.
.sp
\fB\-\-destination\-s3\-prefix\fP (string)
(Optional) The desired S3 prefix for the published data set, similar to a directory path in standard file systems. For example, if given the bucket name "mybucket" and the prefix "myprefix/mydatasets", the output file "outputfile" would be published to "s3://mybucket/myprefix/mydatasets/outputfile". If the prefix directory structure does not exist, it will be created. If no prefix is provided, the data set will be published to the S3 bucket root.
.sp
\fB\-\-sns\-topic\-arn\fP (string)
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the SNS Topic that will be notified when the data set has been published or if an error has occurred.
.sp
\fB\-\-customer\-defined\-values\fP (map)
(Optional) Key\-value pairs which will be returned, unmodified, in the Amazon SNS notification message and the data set metadata file. These key\-value pairs can be used to correlated responses with tracking information from other systems.key \-> (string)

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

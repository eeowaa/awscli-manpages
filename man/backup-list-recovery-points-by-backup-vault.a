.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-backup\-vault\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the AWS Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The next item following a partial list of returned items. For example, if a request is made to return \fBmaxResults\fP number of items, \fBNextToken\fP allows you to return more items in your list starting at the location pointed to by the next token.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of items to be returned.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-by\-resource\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns only recovery points that match the specified resource Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-by\-resource\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns only recovery points that match the specified resource type.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-by\-backup\-plan\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-by\-created\-before\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

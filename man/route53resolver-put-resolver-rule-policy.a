.sp
\fB\-\-resolver\-rule\-policy\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An AWS Identity and Access Management policy statement that lists the rules that you want to share with another AWS account and the operations that you want the account to be able to perform. You can specify the following operations in the \fBAction\fP section of the statement:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBroute53resolver:GetResolverRule\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBroute53resolver:AssociateResolverRule\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBroute53resolver:DisassociateResolverRule\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBroute53resolver:ListResolverRules\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBroute53resolver:ListResolverRuleAssociations\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the \fBResource\fP section of the statement, specify the ARN for the rule that you want to share with another account. Specify the same ARN that you specified in \fBArn\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

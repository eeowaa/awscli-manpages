.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the firewall configurations that you have defined. DNS Firewall uses the configurations to manage firewall behavior for your VPCs.
.sp
A single call might return only a partial list of the configurations. For information, see \fBMaxResults\fP .
.sp
See also: AWS API Documentation
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBlist\-firewall\-configs\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBFirewallConfigs\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
NextToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide this token in your next request.
.UNINDENT

.sp
FirewallConfigs \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The configurations for the firewall behavior provided by DNS Firewall for Amazon virtual private clouds (VPC).
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Configuration of the firewall behavior provided by DNS Firewall for a single Amazon virtual private cloud (VPC).
.sp
Id \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Id of the firewall configuration.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ResourceId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the VPC that this firewall configuration applies to.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
OwnerId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The AWS account ID of the owner of the VPC that this firewall configuration applies to.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
FirewallFailOpen \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Determines how DNS Firewall operates during failures, for example when all traffic that is sent to DNS Firewall fails to receive a reply.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS Firewall returns a failure error when it is unable to properly evaluate a query.
.IP \(bu 2
If you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This approach favors availability over security. DNS Firewall allows queries to proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This behavior is only enforced for VPCs that have at least one DNS Firewall rule group association.

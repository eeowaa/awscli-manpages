.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-user\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the IAM user for whom you want to enable the MFA device.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-

.sp
\fB\-\-serial\-number\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The serial number that uniquely identifies the MFA device. For virtual MFA devices, the serial number is the device ARN.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@:/\-

\fB\-\-authentication\-code1\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An authentication code emitted by the device.
.sp
The format for this parameter is a string of six digits.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Submit your request immediately after generating the authentication codes. If you generate the codes and then wait too long to submit the request, the MFA device successfully associates with the user but the MFA device becomes out of sync. This happens because time\-based one\-time passwords (TOTP) expire after a short period of time. If this happens, you can \fI\%resync the device\fP .

\fB\-\-authentication\-code2\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A subsequent authentication code emitted by the device.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo enable an MFA device\fP
.sp
After you use the \fBcreate\-virtual\-mfa\-device\fP command to create a new virtual MFA device, you can assign the MFA device to a user. The following \fBenable\-mfa\-device\fP example assigns the MFA device with the serial number \fBarn:aws:iam::210987654321:mfa/BobsMFADevice\fP to the user \fBBob\fP\&. The command also synchronizes the device with AWS by including the first two codes in sequence from the virtual MFA device.

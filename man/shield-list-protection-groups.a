.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The next token value from a previous call to \fBListProtectionGroups\fP . Pass null if this is the first call.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of  ProtectionGroup objects to return. If you leave this blank, Shield Advanced returns the first 20 results.
.sp
This is a maximum value. Shield Advanced might return the results in smaller batches. That is, the number of objects returned could be less than \fBMaxResults\fP , even if there are still more objects yet to return. If there are more objects to return, Shield Advanced returns a value in \fBNextToken\fP that you can use in your next request, to get the next batch of objects.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
ProtectionGroups \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A grouping of protected resources that you and AWS Shield Advanced can monitor as a collective. This resource grouping improves the accuracy of detection and reduces false positives.
.sp
ProtectionGroupId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the protection group. You use this to identify the protection group in lists and to manage the protection group, for example to update, delete, or describe it.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Aggregation \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Defines how AWS Shield combines resource data for the group in order to detect, mitigate, and report events.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Sum \- Use the total traffic across the group. This is a good choice for most cases. Examples include Elastic IP addresses for EC2 instances that scale manually or automatically.
.IP \(bu 2
Mean \- Use the average of the traffic across the group. This is a good choice for resources that share traffic uniformly. Examples include accelerators and load balancers.
.IP \(bu 2
Max \- Use the highest traffic from each resource. This is useful for resources that don\(aqt share traffic and for resources that share that traffic in a non\-uniform way. Examples include CloudFront distributions and origin resources for CloudFront distributions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pattern \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The criteria to use to choose the protected resources for inclusion in the group. You can include all resources that have protections, provide a list of resource Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), or include all resources of a specified resource type.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ResourceType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The resource type to include in the protection group. All protected resources of this type are included in the protection group. You must set this when you set \fBPattern\fP to \fBBY_RESOURCE_TYPE\fP and you must not set it for any other \fBPattern\fP setting.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Members \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to include in the protection group. You must set this when you set \fBPattern\fP to \fBARBITRARY\fP and you must not set it for any other \fBPattern\fP setting.
.sp
(string)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ProtectionGroupArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the protection group.

.sp
NextToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you specify a value for \fBMaxResults\fP and you have more protection groups than the value of MaxResults, AWS Shield Advanced returns this token that you can use in your next request, to get the next batch of objects.

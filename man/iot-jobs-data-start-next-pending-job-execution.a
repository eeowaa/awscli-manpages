\fB\-\-step\-timeout\-in\-minutes\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the amount of time this device has to finish execution of this job. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state before this timer expires, or before the timer is reset (by calling \fBUpdateJobExecution\fP , setting the status to \fBIN_PROGRESS\fP and specifying a new timeout value in field \fBstepTimeoutInMinutes\fP ) the job execution status will be automatically set to \fBTIMED_OUT\fP . Note that setting this timeout has no effect on that job execution timeout which may have been specified when the job was created (\fBCreateJob\fP using field \fBtimeoutConfig\fP ).
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
glue-start-export-labels-task-run \- Begins an asynchronous task to export all labeled data for a particular transform
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Begins an asynchronous task to export all labeled data for a particular transform. This task is the only label\-related API call that is not part of the typical active learning workflow. You typically use \fBStartExportLabelsTaskRun\fP when you want to work with all of your existing labels at the same time, such as when you want to remove or change labels that were previously submitted as truth. This API operation accepts the \fBTransformId\fP whose labels you want to export and an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path to export the labels to. The operation returns a \fBTaskRunId\fP . You can check on the status of your task run by calling the \fBGetMLTaskRun\fP API.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

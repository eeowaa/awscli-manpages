.SH NAME
route53-list-geo-locations \- Retrieves a list of supported geographic locations
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves a list of supported geographic locations.
.sp
Countries are listed first, and continents are listed last. If Amazon Route 53 supports subdivisions for a country (for example, states or provinces), the subdivisions for that country are listed in alphabetical order immediately after the corresponding country.
.sp
Route 53 does not perform authorization for this API because it retrieves information that is already available to the public.
.sp
For a list of supported geolocation codes, see the \fI\%GeoLocation\fP data type.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-start\-continent\-code\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The code for the continent with which you want to start listing locations that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has already returned a page or more of results, if \fBIsTruncated\fP is true, and if \fBNextContinentCode\fP from the previous response has a value, enter that value in \fBstartcontinentcode\fP to return the next page of results.
.sp
Include \fBstartcontinentcode\fP only if you want to list continents. Don\(aqt include \fBstartcontinentcode\fP when you\(aqre listing countries or countries with their subdivisions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-start\-country\-code\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The code for the country with which you want to start listing locations that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has already returned a page or more of results, if \fBIsTruncated\fP is \fBtrue\fP , and if \fBNextCountryCode\fP from the previous response has a value, enter that value in \fBstartcountrycode\fP to return the next page of results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-start\-subdivision\-code\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The code for the state of the United States with which you want to start listing locations that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has already returned a page or more of results, if \fBIsTruncated\fP is \fBtrue\fP , and if \fBNextSubdivisionCode\fP from the previous response has a value, enter that value in \fBstartsubdivisioncode\fP to return the next page of results.
.sp
To list subdivisions (U.S. states), you must include both \fBstartcountrycode\fP and \fBstartsubdivisioncode\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) The maximum number of geolocations to be included in the response body for this request. If more than \fBmaxitems\fP geolocations remain to be listed, then the value of the \fBIsTruncated\fP element in the response is \fBtrue\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

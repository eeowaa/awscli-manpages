.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-load\-balancer\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the load balancer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-health\-check\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The configuration information.
.sp
Target \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The instance being checked. The protocol is either TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, or SSL. The range of valid ports is one (1) through 65535.
.sp
TCP is the default, specified as a TCP: port pair, for example "\fI\%TCP:5000\fP". In this case, a health check simply attempts to open a TCP connection to the instance on the specified port. Failure to connect within the configured timeout is considered unhealthy.
.sp
SSL is also specified as SSL: port pair, for example, SSL:5000.
.sp
For HTTP/HTTPS, you must include a ping path in the string. HTTP is specified as a \fI\%HTTP:port;/;PathToPing\fP; grouping, for example "\fI\%HTTP:80/weather/us/wa/seattle\fP". In this case, a HTTP GET request is issued to the instance on the given port and path. Any answer other than "200 OK" within the timeout period is considered unhealthy.
.sp
The total length of the HTTP ping target must be 1024 16\-bit Unicode characters or less.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Interval \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The approximate interval, in seconds, between health checks of an individual instance.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Timeout \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a failed health check.
.sp
This value must be less than the \fBInterval\fP value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
UnhealthyThreshold \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of consecutive health check failures required before moving the instance to the \fBUnhealthy\fP state.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HealthyThreshold \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of consecutive health checks successes required before moving the instance to the \fBHealthy\fP state.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

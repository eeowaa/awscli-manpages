.SH NAME
storagegateway-create-tape-with-barcode \- Creates a virtual tape by using your own barcode
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a virtual tape by using your own barcode. You write data to the virtual tape and then archive the tape. A barcode is unique and cannot be reused if it has already been used on a tape. This applies to barcodes used on deleted tapes. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Cache storage must be allocated to the gateway before you can create a virtual tape. Use the  AddCache operation to add cache storage to a gateway.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

TrainingParameters \-> (map)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of the training parameters in the \fBMLModel\fP . The list is implemented as a map of key\-value pairs.
.sp
The following is the current set of training parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsgd.maxMLModelSizeInBytes\fP \- The maximum allowed size of the model. Depending on the input data, the size of the model might affect its performance. The value is an integer that ranges from \fB100000\fP to \fB2147483648\fP . The default value is \fB33554432\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsgd.maxPasses\fP \- The number of times that the training process traverses the observations to build the \fBMLModel\fP . The value is an integer that ranges from \fB1\fP to \fB10000\fP . The default value is \fB10\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsgd.shuffleType\fP \- Whether Amazon ML shuffles the training data. Shuffling data improves a model\(aqs ability to find the optimal solution for a variety of data types. The valid values are \fBauto\fP and \fBnone\fP . The default value is \fBnone\fP . We strongly recommend that you shuffle your data.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsgd.l1RegularizationAmount\fP \- The coefficient regularization L1 norm. It controls overfitting the data by penalizing large coefficients. This tends to drive coefficients to zero, resulting in a sparse feature set. If you use this parameter, start by specifying a small value, such as \fB1.0E\-08\fP . The value is a double that ranges from \fB0\fP to \fBMAX_DOUBLE\fP . The default is to not use L1 normalization. This parameter can\(aqt be used when \fBL2\fP is specified. Use this parameter sparingly.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsgd.l2RegularizationAmount\fP \- The coefficient regularization L2 norm. It controls overfitting the data by penalizing large coefficients. This tends to drive coefficients to small, nonzero values. If you use this parameter, start by specifying a small value, such as \fB1.0E\-08\fP . The value is a double that ranges from \fB0\fP to \fBMAX_DOUBLE\fP . The default is to not use L2 normalization. This parameter can\(aqt be used when \fBL1\fP is specified. Use this parameter sparingly.

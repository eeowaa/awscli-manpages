.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-instance\-profile\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the instance profile to create.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-path\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path to the instance profile. For more information about paths, see \fI\%IAM Identifiers\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\fB\eu0021\fP ) through the DEL character (\fB\eu007F\fP ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created IAM instance profile. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that represents user\-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, \fBDepartment\fP or \fBCost Center\fP are common choices.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of \fBDepartment\fP could have values such as \fBHuman Resources\fP , \fBAccounting\fP , and \fBSupport\fP . Tags with a key name of \fBCost Center\fP might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AWS always interprets the tag \fBValue\fP as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma\-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

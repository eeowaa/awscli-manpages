In addition, the response contains these fields:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstatus\fP \- The alert status of the check can be \fBok\fP (green), \fBwarning\fP (yellow), \fBerror\fP (red), or \fBnot_available\fP .
.IP \(bu 2

\fB\-\-language\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ISO 639\-1 code for the language in which AWS provides support. AWS Support currently supports English ("en") and Japanese ("ja"). Language parameters must be passed explicitly for operations that take them.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

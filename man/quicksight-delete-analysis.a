.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the analysis. If you don\(aqt specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. QuickSight attaches a \fBDeletionTime\fP stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.
.sp
At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the \fBRestoreAnalysis\fP API operation to remove the \fBDeletionTime\fP stamp and cancel the deletion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it\(aqs deleted, so you can describe it but you can\(aqt make a template from it.
.sp
An analysis that\(aqs scheduled for deletion isn\(aqt accessible in the QuickSight console. To access it in the console, restore it. Deleting an analysis doesn\(aqt delete the dashboards that you publish from it.

\fB\-\-analysis\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the analysis that you\(aqre deleting.

.sp
\fB\-\-recovery\-window\-in\-days\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that specifies the number of days that QuickSight waits before it deletes the analysis. You can\(aqt use this parameter with the \fBForceDeleteWithoutRecovery\fP option in the same API call. The default value is 30.

\fB\-\-force\-delete\-without\-recovery\fP | \fB\-\-no\-force\-delete\-without\-recovery\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This option defaults to the value \fBNoForceDeleteWithoutRecovery\fP . To immediately delete the analysis, add the \fBForceDeleteWithoutRecovery\fP option. You can\(aqt restore an analysis after it\(aqs deleted.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

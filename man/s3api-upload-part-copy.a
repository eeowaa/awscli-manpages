.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. You specify the data source by adding the request header \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\fP in your request and a byte range by adding the request header \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\-range\fP in your request.
.sp
The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more information about multipart upload limits, go to \fI\%Quick Facts\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the \fI\%UploadPart\fP action and provide data in your request.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request.
.sp

Note the following additional considerations about the request headers \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\-if\-match\fP , \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\-if\-none\-match\fP , \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\-if\-unmodified\-since\fP , and \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\-if\-modified\-since\fP :

\fBVersioning\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\fP identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don\(aqt specify a versionId in the \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\fP , Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\fP and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the \fBx\-amz\-copy\-source\fP .
.sp
You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the \fBversionId\fP subresource as shown in the following example:
.INDENT 0.0

\fBx\-amz\-copy\-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-bucket\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The bucket name.
.sp
When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .s3\-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \fI\%Using access points\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .*outpostID* .s3\-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \fI\%Using S3 on Outposts\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-copy\-source\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an \fI\%access point\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object \fBreports/january.pdf\fP from the bucket \fBawsexamplebucket\fP , use \fBawsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf\fP . The value must be URL encoded.
.IP \(bu 2
For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format \fBarn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account\-id>:accesspoint/<access\-point\-name>/object/<key>\fP . For example, to copy the object \fBreports/january.pdf\fP through access point \fBmy\-access\-point\fP owned by account \fB123456789012\fP in Region \fBus\-west\-2\fP , use the URL encoding of \fBarn:aws:s3:us\-west\-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my\-access\-point/object/reports/january.pdf\fP . The value must be URL encoded.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same AWS Region.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format \fBarn:aws:s3\-outposts:<Region>:<account\-id>:outpost/<outpost\-id>/object/<key>\fP . For example, to copy the object \fBreports/january.pdf\fP through outpost \fBmy\-outpost\fP owned by account \fB123456789012\fP in Region \fBus\-west\-2\fP , use the URL encoding of \fBarn:aws:s3\-outposts:us\-west\-2:123456789012:outpost/my\-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf\fP . The value must be URL encoded.
.UNINDENT

To copy a specific version of an object, append \fB?versionId=<version\-id>\fP to the value (for example, \fBawsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893\fP ). If you don\(aqt specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-copy\-source\-if\-none\-match\fP (string)

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-copy\-source\-if\-unmodified\-since\fP (timestamp)

.INDENT 3.5
Copies the object if it hasn\(aqt been modified since the specified time.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-copy\-source\-range\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value must use the form bytes=first\-last, where the first and last are the zero\-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0\-9 indicates that you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a range only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.

Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
iam-attach-role-policy \- Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM role

Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM role. When you attach a managed policy to a role, the managed policy becomes part of the role\(aqs permission (access) policy.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You cannot use a managed policy as the role\(aqs trust policy. The role\(aqs trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using  CreateRole . You can update a role\(aqs trust policy using  UpdateAssumeRolePolicy .

.sp
Use this operation to attach a \fImanaged\fP policy to a role. To embed an inline policy in a role, use  PutRolePolicy . For more information about policies, see \fI\%Managed policies and inline policies\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see \fI\%Validating IAM policies\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-role\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the role to attach the policy to.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns a list of findings that match the specified criteria.
.sp

See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBget\-findings\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBFindings\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-filters\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The finding attributes used to define a condition to filter the returned findings.
.sp
You can filter by up to 10 finding attributes. For each attribute, you can provide up to 20 filter values.
.sp
Note that in the available filter fields, \fBWorkflowState\fP is deprecated. To search for a finding based on its workflow status, use \fBWorkflowStatus\fP .
.sp
ProductArn \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN generated by Security Hub that uniquely identifies a third\-party company (security findings provider) after this provider\(aqs product (solution that generates findings) is registered with Security Hub.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A string filter for querying findings.
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The string filter value. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control\-based findings is \fBSecurity Hub\fP . If you provide \fBsecurity hub\fP as the filter text, then there is no match.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Comparison \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The condition to apply to a string value when querying for findings. To search for values that contain the filter criteria value, use one of the following comparison operators:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use \fBEQUALS\fP . For example, the filter \fBResourceType EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup\fP only matches findings that have a resource type of \fBAwsEc2SecurityGroup\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
To search for values that start with the filter value, use \fBPREFIX\fP . For example, the filter \fBResourceType PREFIX AwsIam\fP matches findings that have a resource type that starts with \fBAwsIam\fP . Findings with a resource type of \fBAwsIamPolicy\fP , \fBAwsIamRole\fP , or \fBAwsIamUser\fP would all match.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBEQUALS\fP and \fBPREFIX\fP filters on the same field are joined by \fBOR\fP . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To search for values that do not contain the filter criteria value, use one of the following comparison operators:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To search for values that do not exactly match the filter value, use \fBNOT_EQUALS\fP . For example, the filter \fBResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy\fP matches findings that have a resource type other than \fBAwsIamPolicy\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
To search for values that do not start with the filter value, use \fBPREFIX_NOT_EQUALS\fP . For example, the filter \fBResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam\fP matches findings that have a resource type that does not start with \fBAwsIam\fP . Findings with a resource type of \fBAwsIamPolicy\fP , \fBAwsIamRole\fP , or \fBAwsIamUser\fP would all be excluded from the results.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBNOT_EQUALS\fP and \fBPREFIX_NOT_EQUALS\fP filters on the same field are joined by \fBAND\fP . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an \fBEQUALS\fP filter and a \fBNOT_EQUALS\fP or \fBPREFIX_NOT_EQUALS\fP filter. Combining filters in this way always returns an error, even if the provided filter values would return valid results.
.sp
You can combine \fBPREFIX\fP filters with \fBNOT_EQUALS\fP or \fBPREFIX_NOT_EQUALS\fP filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the \fBPREFIX\fP filters, then the \fBNOT_EQUALS\fP or \fBPREFIX_NOT_EQUALS\fP filters.
.sp
For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either \fBAwsIAM\fP or \fBAwsEc2\fP . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of \fBAwsIamPolicy\fP and findings that have a resource type of \fBAwsEc2NetworkInterface\fP .

For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an \fBEQUALS\fP filter and a \fBNOT_EQUALS\fP or \fBPREFIX_NOT_EQUALS\fP filter. Combining filters in this way always returns an error, even if the provided filter values would return valid results.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.

\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)

.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request.

Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
\fB\-\-description\fP (string)
The new description for the queue, if you are changing it.
.sp
\fB\-\-name\fP (string)
The name of the queue that you are modifying.
.sp
\fB\-\-reservation\-plan\-settings\fP (structure)
The new details of your pricing plan for your reserved queue. When you set up a new pricing plan to replace an expired one, you enter into another 12\-month commitment. When you add capacity to your queue by increasing the number of RTS, you extend the term of your commitment to 12 months from when you add capacity. After you make these commitments, you can\(aqt cancel them.Commitment \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
RenewalType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies whether the term of your reserved queue pricing plan is automatically extended (AUTO_RENEW) or expires (EXPIRE) at the end of the term. When your term is auto renewed, you extend your commitment by 12 months from the auto renew date. You can cancel this commitment.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ReservedSlots \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the number of reserved transcode slots (RTS) for this queue. The number of RTS determines how many jobs the queue can process in parallel; each RTS can process one job at a time. You can\(aqt decrease the number of RTS in your reserved queue. You can increase the number of RTS by extending your existing commitment with a new 12\-month commitment for the larger number. The new commitment begins when you purchase the additional capacity. You can\(aqt cancel your commitment or revert to your original commitment after you increase the capacity.

\fB\-\-status\fP (string)

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

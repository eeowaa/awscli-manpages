.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the configuration of the firewall behavior provided by DNS Firewall for a single Amazon virtual private cloud (VPC).
.sp
See also: AWS API Documentation
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-resource\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the Amazon virtual private cloud (VPC) that the configuration is for.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-fail\-open\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Determines how Route 53 Resolver handles queries during failures, for example when all traffic that is sent to DNS Firewall fails to receive a reply.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS Firewall blocks queries that it is unable to evaluate properly.
.IP \(bu 2
If you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This approach favors availability over security. DNS Firewall allows queries to proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This behavior is only enforced for VPCs that have at least one DNS Firewall rule group association.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Determines how DNS Firewall operates during failures, for example when all traffic that is sent to DNS Firewall fails to receive a reply.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS Firewall returns a failure error when it is unable to properly evaluate a query.

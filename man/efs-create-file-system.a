.SH NAME
efs-create-file-system \- Creates a new, empty file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller\(aqs AWS account with the specified creation token, this operation does the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state \fBcreating\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
Returns with the description of the created file system.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Otherwise, this operation returns a \fBFileSystemAlreadyExists\fP error with the ID of the existing file system.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation token.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The idempotent operation allows you to retry a \fBCreateFileSystem\fP call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of its existence from the \fBFileSystemAlreadyExists\fP error.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Creating a file system\fP in the \fIAmazon EFS User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBCreateFileSystem\fP call returns while the file system\(aqs lifecycle state is still \fBcreating\fP . You can check the file system creation status by calling the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which among other things returns the file system state.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation accepts an optional \fBPerformanceMode\fP parameter that you choose for your file system. We recommend \fBgeneralPurpose\fP performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the \fBmaxIO\fP performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can\(aqt be changed after the file system has been created. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon EFS performance modes\fP .
.sp
You can set the throughput mode for the file system using the \fBThroughputMode\fP parameter.
.sp
After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to \fBavailable\fP , at which point you can create one or more mount targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see  CreateMountTarget . You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by using the mount target. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon EFS: How it Works\fP .
.sp
This operation requires permissions for the \fBelasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem\fP action.

\fB\-\-encrypted\fP | \fB\-\-no\-encrypted\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying  CreateFileSystemRequest$KmsKeyId for an existing AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). If you don\(aqt specify a CMK, then the default CMK for Amazon EFS, \fB/aws/elasticfilesystem\fP , is used to protect the encrypted file system.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the AWS KMS CMK that you want to use to protect the encrypted file system. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non\-default KMS key. If this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for Amazon EFS is used. This ID can be in one of the following formats:
.INDENT 0.0

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

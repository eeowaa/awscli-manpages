.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task. You use data repository tasks to perform bulk operations between your Amazon FSx file system and its linked data repository. An example of a data repository task is exporting any data and metadata changes, including POSIX metadata, to files, directories, and symbolic links (symlinks) from your FSx file system to its linked data repository. A \fBCreateDataRepositoryTask\fP operation will fail if a data repository is not linked to the FSx file system. To learn more about data repository tasks, see \fI\%Data Repository Tasks\fP . To learn more about linking a data repository to your file system, see \fI\%Linking your file system to an S3 bucket\fP .

(Optional) The path or paths on the Amazon FSx file system to use when the data repository task is processed. The default path is the file system root directory. The paths you provide need to be relative to the mount point of the file system. If the mount point is \fB/mnt/fsx\fP and \fB/mnt/fsx/path1\fP is a directory or file on the file system you want to export, then the path to provide is \fBpath1\fP . If a path that you provide isn\(aqt valid, the task fails.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
cloudtrail-put-event-selectors \- Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail. Use event selectors or advanced event selectors to specify management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events.
.sp
When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn\(aqt match any event selector, the trail doesn\(aqt log the event.
.sp
Example
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write\-only events.
.IP \(bu 2
The EC2 \fBGetConsoleOutput\fP and \fBRunInstances\fP API operations occur in your account.
.IP \(bu 2
CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBRunInstances\fP is a write\-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBGetConsoleOutput\fP is a read\-only event that doesn\(aqt match your event selector. The trail doesn\(aqt log the event.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBPutEventSelectors\fP operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an \fBInvalidHomeRegionException\fP exception is thrown.
.sp
You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more information, see \fI\%Logging data and management events for trails\fP and \fI\%Quotas in AWS CloudTrail\fP in the \fIAWS CloudTrail User Guide\fP .
.sp
You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either \fBAdvancedEventSelectors\fP or \fBEventSelectors\fP , but not both. If you apply \fBAdvancedEventSelectors\fP to a trail, any existing \fBEventSelectors\fP are overwritten. For more information about advanced event selectors, see \fI\%Logging data events for trails\fP in the \fIAWS CloudTrail User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-event\-selectors\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the settings for your event selectors. You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail. You can use either \fBEventSelectors\fP or \fBAdvancedEventSelectors\fP in a \fBPutEventSelectors\fP request, but not both. If you apply \fBEventSelectors\fP to a trail, any existing \fBAdvancedEventSelectors\fP are overwritten.

.INDENT 3.5
Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn\(aqt match any event selector, the trail doesn\(aqt log the event.
.sp
You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.
.sp
You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.
.sp
ReadWriteType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specify if you want your trail to log read\-only events, write\-only events, or all. For example, the EC2 \fBGetConsoleOutput\fP is a read\-only API operation and \fBRunInstances\fP is a write\-only API operation.
.sp
By default, the value is \fBAll\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
IncludeManagementEvents \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specify if you want your event selector to include management events for your trail.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Management Events\fP in the \fIAWS CloudTrail User Guide\fP .
.sp
By default, the value is \fBtrue\fP .
.sp
The first copy of management events is free. You are charged for additional copies of management events that you are logging on any subsequent trail in the same region. For more information about CloudTrail pricing, see \fI\%AWS CloudTrail Pricing\fP .

.sp
DataResources \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects and AWS Lambda functions. You can specify up to 250 resources for an individual event selector, but the total number of data resources cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This limit does not apply if you configure resource logging for all data events.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Data Events\fP and \fI\%Limits in AWS CloudTrail\fP in the \fIAWS CloudTrail User Guide\fP .
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon S3 buckets or AWS Lambda functions that you specify in your event selectors for your trail to log data events. Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or within a resource itself. These are also known as data plane operations. You can specify up to 250 data resources for a trail.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of allowed data resources is 250. This number can be distributed between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot exceed 250 across all selectors.
.sp
If you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum total number of values for all conditions, across all advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named \fBbucket\-1\fP . In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and the option to log both \fBRead\fP and \fBWrite\fP data events.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A user uploads an image file to \fBbucket\-1\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBPutObject\fP API operation is an Amazon S3 object\-level API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.
.IP \(bu 2
A user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named \fBarn:aws:s3:::bucket\-2\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBPutObject\fP API operation occurred for an object in an S3 bucket that the CloudTrail user didn\(aqt specify for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of AWS Lambda data events for a Lambda function named \fIMyLambdaFunction\fP , but not for all AWS Lambda functions.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A user runs a script that includes a call to the \fIMyLambdaFunction\fP function and the \fIMyOtherLambdaFunction\fP function.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBInvoke\fP API operation on \fIMyLambdaFunction\fP is an AWS Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for \fIMyLambdaFunction\fP , any invocations of that function are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBInvoke\fP API operation on \fIMyOtherLambdaFunction\fP is an AWS Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the \fBInvoke\fP operation for \fIMyOtherLambdaFunction\fP does not match the function specified for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Type \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify \fBAWS::S3::Object\fP or \fBAWS::Lambda::Function\fP resources.
.sp
The \fBAWS::S3Outposts::Object\fP resource type is not valid in basic event selectors. To log data events on this resource type, use advanced event selectors.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Values \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or partial ARN strings for the specified objects.
.INDENT 0.0

To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets in your AWS account, specify the prefix as \fBarn:aws:s3:::\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

This will also enable logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another AWS account.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket, specify the bucket and an empty object prefix such as \fBarn:aws:s3:::bucket\-1/\fP . The trail logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket.
.IP \(bu 2
To log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix such as \fBarn:aws:s3:::bucket\-1/example\-images\fP . The trail logs data events for objects in this S3 bucket that match the prefix.
.IP \(bu 2
To log data events for all functions in your AWS account, specify the prefix as \fBarn:aws:lambda\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp

\fBTo configure event selectors for a trail\fP
.sp
To create an event selector, run the \(aq\(aqput\-event\-selectors\(aq\(aq command. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates
the configuration for your trails. If the event matches any event selector for a trail, the trail processes and logs the event.
You can configure up to 5 event selectors for a trail and up to 250 data resources for a trail.

.INDENT 3.5
Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn\(aqt match any event selector, the trail doesn\(aqt log the event.

The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named \fBbucket\-1\fP . In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and the option to log both \fBRead\fP and \fBWrite\fP data events.

The \fBPutObject\fP API operation is an Amazon S3 object\-level API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.

The \fBInvoke\fP API operation on \fIMyLambdaFunction\fP is an AWS Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for \fIMyLambdaFunction\fP , any invocations of that function are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBInvoke\fP API operation on \fIMyOtherLambdaFunction\fP is an AWS Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the \fBInvoke\fP operation for \fIMyOtherLambdaFunction\fP does not match the function specified for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.

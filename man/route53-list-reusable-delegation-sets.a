.sp
\fB\-\-marker\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the value of \fBIsTruncated\fP in the previous response was \fBtrue\fP , you have more reusable delegation sets. To get another group, submit another \fBListReusableDelegationSets\fP request.
.sp
For the value of \fBmarker\fP , specify the value of \fBNextMarker\fP from the previous response, which is the ID of the first reusable delegation set that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request.
.sp
If the value of \fBIsTruncated\fP in the previous response was \fBfalse\fP , there are no more reusable delegation sets to get.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of reusable delegation sets that you want Amazon Route 53 to return in the response to this request. If you specify a value greater than 100, Route 53 returns only the first 100 reusable delegation sets.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

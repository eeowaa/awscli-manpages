.SH NAME
s3api-list-parts \- Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload. This operation must include the upload ID, which you obtain by sending the initiate multipart upload request (see \fI\%CreateMultipartUpload\fP ). This request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The default number of parts returned is 1,000 parts. You can restrict the number of parts returned by specifying the \fBmax\-parts\fP request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an \fBIsTruncated\fP field with the value of true, and a \fBNextPartNumberMarker\fP element. In subsequent \fBListParts\fP requests you can include the part\-number\-marker query string parameter and set its value to the \fBNextPartNumberMarker\fP field value from the previous response.

\fBlist\-parts\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBParts\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-bucket\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the bucket to which the parts are being uploaded.
.sp
When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .s3\-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \fI\%Using access points\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .*outpostID* .s3\-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \fI\%Using S3 on Outposts\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-upload\-id\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-request\-payer\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. For information about downloading objects from requester pays buckets, see \fI\%Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .

Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0

\fBrequester\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-expected\-bucket\-owner\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP \fB403 (Access Denied)\fP error.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
s3-rb \- Deletes an empty S3 bucket
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes an empty S3 bucket. A bucket must be completely empty of objects and versioned objects before it can be deleted. However, the \fB\-\-force\fP parameter can be used to delete the non\-versioned objects in the bucket before the bucket is deleted.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fBpath\fP (string)
.sp
\fB\-\-force\fP (boolean)
Deletes all objects in the bucket including the bucket itself. Note that versioned objects will not be deleted in this process which would cause the bucket deletion to fail because the bucket would not be empty. To delete versioned objects use the \fBs3api delete\-object\fP command with the \fB\-\-version\-id\fP parameter.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

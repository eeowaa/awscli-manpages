\fBlist\-stack\-set\-operations\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBSummaries\fP

\fB\-\-stack\-set\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to get operation summaries for.

.sp
\fB\-\-call\-as\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
[Service\-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization\(aqs management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.
.sp
By default, \fBSELF\fP is specified. Use \fBSELF\fP for stack sets with self\-managed permissions.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you are signed in to the management account, specify \fBSELF\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify \fBDELEGATED_ADMIN\fP . Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see \fI\%Register a delegated administrator\fP in the \fIAWS CloudFormation User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Summaries \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of \fBStackSetOperationSummary\fP structures that contain summary information about operations for the specified stack set.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The structures that contain summary information about the specified operation.
.sp
OperationId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique ID of the stack set operation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Action \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of operation: \fBCREATE\fP , \fBUPDATE\fP , or \fBDELETE\fP . Create and delete operations affect only the specified stack instances that are associated with the specified stack set. Update operations affect both the stack set itself as well as \fIall\fP associated stack set instances.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The overall status of the operation.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP : The operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance. The failure tolerance value that you\(aqve set for an operation is applied for each Region during stack create and update operations. If the number of failed stacks within a Region exceeds the failure tolerance, the status of the operation in the Region is set to \fBFAILED\fP . This in turn sets the status of the operation as a whole to \fBFAILED\fP , and AWS CloudFormation cancels the operation in any remaining Regions.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBQUEUED\fP : [Service\-managed permissions] For automatic deployments that require a sequence of operations, the operation is queued to be performed. For more information, see the \fI\%stack set operation status codes\fP in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRUNNING\fP : The operation is currently being performed.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSTOPPED\fP : The user has cancelled the operation.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSTOPPING\fP : The operation is in the process of stopping, at user request.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSUCCEEDED\fP : The operation completed creating or updating all the specified stacks without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation.

.sp
CreationTimestamp \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the creation times for the stack set operation might differ from the creation time of the individual stacks themselves. This is because AWS CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work for the operation, such as dispatching the work to the requested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EndTimestamp \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The time at which the stack set operation ended, across all accounts and Regions specified. Note that this doesn\(aqt necessarily mean that the stack set operation was successful, or even attempted, in each account or Region.

NextToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the request doesn\(aqt return all results, \fBNextToken\fP is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call \fBListOperationResults\fP again and assign that token to the request object\(aqs \fBNextToken\fP parameter. If there are no remaining results, \fBNextToken\fP is set to \fBnull\fP .

.SH NAME
datasync-create-task \- Creates a task
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a task.
.sp
A task includes a source location and a destination location, and a configuration that specifies how data is transferred. A task always transfers data from the source location to the destination location. The configuration specifies options such as task scheduling, bandwidth limits, etc. A task is the complete definition of a data transfer.
.sp
When you create a task that transfers data between AWS services in different AWS Regions, one of the two locations that you specify must reside in the Region where DataSync is being used. The other location must be specified in a different Region.
.sp
You can transfer data between commercial AWS Regions except for China, or between AWS GovCloud (US\-East and US\-West) Regions.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you use DataSync to copy files or objects between AWS Regions, you pay for data transfer between Regions. This is billed as data transfer OUT from your source Region to your destination Region. For more information, see \fI\%Data Transfer pricing\fP .

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-options\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The set of configuration options that control the behavior of a single execution of the task that occurs when you call \fBStartTaskExecution\fP . You can configure these options to preserve metadata such as user ID (UID) and group ID (GID), file permissions, data integrity verification, and so on.
.sp
For each individual task execution, you can override these options by specifying the \fBOverrideOptions\fP before starting the task execution. For more information, see the \fI\%StartTaskExecution\fP operation.
.sp
VerifyMode \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see \fI\%Configure task settings\fP .
.sp
Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.
.sp
ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred.
.sp
POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn\(aqt supported when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.
.sp
NONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity\-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
OverwriteMode \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to \fBNEVER\fP a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes.
.sp
Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed information, see \fI\%Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync\fP in the \fIAWS DataSync User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Atime \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you set \fBAtime\fP to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original \fBAtime\fP attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, \fBAtime\fP \(aqs behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best\-effort basis.
.sp
Default value: BEST_EFFORT.
.sp
BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per\-file \fBAtime\fP value (recommended).
.sp
NONE: Ignore \fBAtime\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If \fBAtime\fP is set to BEST_EFFORT, \fBMtime\fP must be set to PRESERVE.

If \fBAtime\fP is set to NONE, \fBMtime\fP must also be NONE.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Mtime \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
Default value: PRESERVE.
.sp
PRESERVE: Preserve original \fBMtime\fP (recommended)
.sp
NONE: Ignore \fBMtime\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If \fBMtime\fP is set to PRESERVE, \fBAtime\fP must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Gid \-> (string)

.UNINDENT
.sp
PreserveDeletedFiles \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don\(aqt exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see \fI\%Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync\fP in the \fIAWS DataSync User Guide\fP .
.sp
Default value: PRESERVE.
.sp
PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
AWS DataSync can\(aqt sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don\(aqt return an end\-of\-file (EOF) marker.
.UNINDENT

.sp
Default value: PRESERVE.
.sp
PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX\-style permissions (recommended).
.sp
NONE: Ignore permissions.
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.UNINDENT
.sp
LogLevel \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
TransferMode \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location.
.sp
CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.
.sp
ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects.
.sp
This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see \fI\%How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files\fP .
.sp
Default value: OWNER_DACL.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Object owner.
.IP \(bu 2
NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBOWNER_DACL_SACL\fP : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Object owner.
.IP \(bu 2
NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.
.IP \(bu 2
NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see \fI\%user\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBNONE\fP : None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination serverâ€™s configuration.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Modifies the flag, \fBDeleteProtection\fP , which indicates whether it is possible to delete the firewall. If the flag is set to \fBTRUE\fP , the firewall is protected against deletion. This setting helps protect against accidentally deleting a firewall that\(aqs in use.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-update\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request.
.sp
To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it.
.sp
To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn\(aqt changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an \fBInvalidTokenException\fP . If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.

.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.
.sp
You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The descriptive name of the firewall. You can\(aqt change the name of a firewall after you create it.
.sp
You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-delete\-protection\fP | \fB\-\-no\-delete\-protection\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A setting of \fBTRUE\fP indicates that the firewall is protected against deletion. Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this flag to \fBTRUE\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Increases the Kinesis data stream\(aqs retention period, which is the length of time data records are accessible after they are added to the stream. The maximum value of a stream\(aqs retention period is 168 hours (7 days).
.sp
If you choose a longer stream retention period, this operation increases the time period during which records that have not yet expired are accessible. However, it does not make previous, expired data (older than the stream\(aqs previous retention period) accessible after the operation has been called. For example, if a stream\(aqs retention period is set to 24 hours and is increased to 168 hours, any data that is older than 24 hours remains inaccessible to consumer applications.

The name of the stream to modify.

\fB\-\-retention\-period\-hours\fP (integer)

The new retention period of the stream, in hours. Must be more than the current retention period.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

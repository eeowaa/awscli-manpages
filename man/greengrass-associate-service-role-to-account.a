.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-role\-arn\fP (string)
The ARN of the service role you wish to associate with your account.
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBTo associate a service role with your AWS account\fP
.sp
The following \fBassociate\-service\-role\-to\-account\fP example associates an IAM service role, specified by its ARN, with AWS IoT Greengrass in your AWS account.  You must have previously created the service role in IAM, and you must associate a policy document with it that allows AWS IoT Greengrass to assume this role.

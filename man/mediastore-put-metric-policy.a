.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The metric policy that you want to associate with the container. In the policy, you must indicate whether you want MediaStore to send container\-level metrics. You can also include up to five rules to define groups of objects that you want MediaStore to send object\-level metrics for. If you include rules in the policy, construct each rule with both of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An object group that defines which objects to include in the group. The definition can be a path or a file name, but it can\(aqt have more than 900 characters. Valid characters are: a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9, _ (underscore), = (equal), : (colon), . (period), \- (hyphen), ~ (tilde), / (forward slash), and * (asterisk). Wildcards (*) are acceptable.
.IP \(bu 2
An object group name that allows you to refer to the object group. The name can\(aqt have more than 30 characters. Valid characters are: a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9, and _ (underscore).

MetricPolicyRules \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A parameter that holds an array of rules that enable metrics at the object level. This parameter is optional, but if you choose to include it, you must also include at least one rule. By default, you can include up to five rules. You can also \fI\%request a quota increase\fP to allow up to 300 rules per policy.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A setting that enables metrics at the object level. Each rule contains an object group and an object group name. If the policy includes the MetricPolicyRules parameter, you must include at least one rule. Each metric policy can include up to five rules by default. You can also \fI\%request a quota increase\fP to allow up to 300 rules per policy.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
iam-tag-policy \- Adds one or more tags to an IAM customer managed policy
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Adds one or more tags to an IAM customer managed policy. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.
.sp
A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

\fBAdministrative grouping and discovery\fP \- Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name \fIProject\fP and the value \fIMyImportantProject\fP . Or search for all resources with the key name \fICost Center\fP and the value \fI41200\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAccess control\fP \- Include tags in IAM user\-based and resource\-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM customer managed policy that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see \fI\%Control access using IAM tags\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
AWS always interprets the tag \fBValue\fP as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma\-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

.sp
\fB\-\-policy\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the IAM customer managed policy to which you want to add tags.
.sp
This parameter accepts (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters that consist of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@\-

.sp
\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of tags that you want to attach to the IAM customer managed policy. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that represents user\-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see \fI\%Tagging IAM resources\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, \fBDepartment\fP or \fBCost Center\fP are common choices.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of \fBDepartment\fP could have values such as \fBHuman Resources\fP , \fBAccounting\fP , and \fBSupport\fP . Tags with a key name of \fBCost Center\fP might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes one or more of your compute environments.
.sp
If you\(aqre using an unmanaged compute environment, you can use the \fBDescribeComputeEnvironment\fP operation to determine the \fBecsClusterArn\fP that you should launch your Amazon ECS container instances into.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBdescribe\-compute\-environments\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBcomputeEnvironments\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.

For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The state of the compute environment. The valid values are \fBENABLED\fP or \fBDISABLED\fP .

If the state is \fBENABLED\fP , then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.
.sp
If the state is \fBDISABLED\fP , then the AWS Batch scheduler doesn\(aqt attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a \fBSTARTING\fP or \fBRUNNING\fP state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the \fBDISABLED\fP state don\(aqt scale out. However, they scale in to \fBminvCpus\fP value after instances become idle.

allocationStrategy \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated.

BEST_FIT (default)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AWS Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest\-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren\(aqt available, AWS Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren\(aqt enough instances available, or if the user is hitting \fI\%Amazon EC2 service limits\fP then additional jobs aren\(aqt run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with \fBBEST_FIT\fP then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren\(aqt available, AWS Batch will select new instance types.

.INDENT 3.5
SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.
.sp
With both \fBBEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE\fP and \fBSPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED\fP strategies, AWS Batch might need to go above \fBmaxvCpus\fP to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds \fBmaxvCpus\fP by more than a single instance.

For AWS Batch, these take the form of "String1": "String2", where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value−for example, { "Name": "AWS Batch Instance \- C4OnDemand" }. This is helpful for recognizing your AWS Batch instances in the Amazon EC2 console.

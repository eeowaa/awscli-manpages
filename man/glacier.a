.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for "cold data."
.sp
Glacier is an extremely low\-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy\-to\-use storage for data backup and archival. With Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don\(aqt have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time\-consuming hardware migrations.
.sp
Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and your data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)\fP .
.sp
You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in Glacier.

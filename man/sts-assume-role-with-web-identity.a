.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider. Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect\-compatible identity provider.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the \fI\%AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide\fP and the \fI\%AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide\fP to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.
.sp
To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see \fI\%Amazon Cognito Overview\fP in \fIAWS SDK for Android Developer Guide\fP and \fI\%Amazon Cognito Overview\fP in the \fIAWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
Calling \fBAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\fP does not require the use of AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long\-term AWS credentials in the application. You also don\(aqt need to deploy server\-based proxy services that use long\-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of \fBAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\fP with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see \fI\%Requesting Temporary Security Credentials\fP and \fI\%Comparing the AWS STS API operations\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.

.INDENT 3.5
\fBSession Duration\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, the temporary security credentials created by \fBAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\fP last for one hour. However, you can use the optional \fBDurationSeconds\fP parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see \fI\%View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the \fBAssumeRole*\fP API operations or the \fBassume\-role*\fP CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see \fI\%Using IAM Roles\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBPermissions\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The temporary security credentials created by \fBAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\fP can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS \fBGetFederationToken\fP or \fBGetSessionToken\fP API operations.
.sp
(Optional) You can pass inline or managed \fI\%session policies\fP to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can\(aqt exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session\(aqs permissions are the intersection of the role\(aqs identity\-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role\(aqs temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity\-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see \fI\%Session Policies\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBTags\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see \fI\%Passing Session Tags in STS\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see \fI\%IAM and STS Character Limits\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The \fBPackedPolicySize\fP response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with the same key.
.sp
An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see \fI\%Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute\-Based Access Control\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see \fI\%Chaining Roles with Session Tags\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
\fBIdentities\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Before your application can call \fBAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\fP , you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role\(aqs trust policy.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Calling \fBAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\fP can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the \fI\%Subject\fP of the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as \fI\%suggested in the OIDC specification\fP .

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.
.sp
This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session\(aqs permissions are the intersection of the role\(aqs identity\-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role\(aqs temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity\-based policy of the role that is being assumed.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

AssumedRoleUser \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and the assumed role ID, which are identifiers that you can use to refer to the resulting temporary security credentials. For example, you can reference these credentials as a principal in a resource\-based policy by using the ARN or assumed role ID. The ARN and ID include the \fBRoleSessionName\fP that you specified when you called \fBAssumeRole\fP .
.sp
AssumedRoleId \-> (string)

.sp
SourceIdentity \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value of the source identity that is returned in the JSON web token (JWT) from the identity provider.
.sp
You can require users to set a source identity value when they assume a role. You do this by using the \fBsts:SourceIdentity\fP condition key in a role trust policy. That way, actions that are taken with the role are associated with that user. After the source identity is set, the value cannot be changed. It is present in the request for all actions that are taken by the role and persists across \fI\%chained role\fP sessions. You can configure your identity provider to use an attribute associated with your users, like user name or email, as the source identity when calling \fBAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\fP . You do this by adding a claim to the JSON web token. To learn more about OIDC tokens and claims, see \fI\%Using Tokens with User Pools\fP in the \fIAmazon Cognito Developer Guide\fP . For more information about using source identity, see \fI\%Monitor and control actions taken with assumed roles\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

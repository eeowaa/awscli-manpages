.sp
\fB\-\-resolver\-endpoint\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the Resolver endpoint that you want to update.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

\fB\-\-name\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The name of the Resolver endpoint that you want to update.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
ResolverEndpoint \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The response to an \fBUpdateResolverEndpoint\fP request.
.sp
Id \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the Resolver endpoint.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CreatorRequestId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique string that identifies the request that created the Resolver endpoint. The \fBCreatorRequestId\fP allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Arn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver endpoint.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name that you assigned to the Resolver endpoint when you submitted a \fI\%CreateResolverEndpoint\fP request.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SecurityGroupIds \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of one or more security groups that control access to this VPC. The security group must include one or more inbound rules (for inbound endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP access. For inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access, open the port that you\(aqre using for DNS queries on your network.
.sp
(string)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Direction \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether the Resolver endpoint allows inbound or outbound DNS queries:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINBOUND\fP : allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOUTBOUND\fP : allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
IpAddressCount \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of IP addresses that the Resolver endpoint can use for DNS queries.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
HostVPCId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the VPC that you want to create the Resolver endpoint in.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver endpoint. Valid values include the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATING\fP : Resolver is creating and configuring one or more Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOPERATIONAL\fP : The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint are correctly configured and able to pass inbound or outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUPDATING\fP : Resolver is associating or disassociating one or more network interfaces with this endpoint.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAUTO_RECOVERING\fP : Resolver is trying to recover one or more of the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint. During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with limited capacity because of the limit on the number of DNS queries per IP address (per network interface). For the current limit, see \fI\%Limits on Route 53 Resolver\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACTION_NEEDED\fP : This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can\(aqt automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend that you check each IP address that you associated with the endpoint. For each IP address that isn\(aqt available, add another IP address and then delete the IP address that isn\(aqt available. (An endpoint must always include at least two IP addresses.) A status of \fBACTION_NEEDED\fP can have a variety of causes. Here are two common causes:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
One or more of the network interfaces that are associated with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.
.IP \(bu 2
The network interface couldn\(aqt be created for some reason that\(aqs outside the control of Resolver.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETING\fP : Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the associated network interfaces.

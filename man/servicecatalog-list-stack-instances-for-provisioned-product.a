\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
StackInstances \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
List of stack instances.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An AWS CloudFormation stack, in a specific account and region, that\(aqs part of a stack set operation. A stack instance is a reference to an attempted or actual stack in a given account within a given region. A stack instance can exist without a stackâ€”for example, if the stack couldn\(aqt be created for some reason. A stack instance is associated with only one stack set. Each stack instance contains the ID of its associated stack set, as well as the ID of the actual stack and the stack status.
.sp
Account \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the AWS account that the stack instance is associated with.
.UNINDENT

.sp
Region \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the AWS region that the stack instance is associated with.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
StackInstanceStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the stack instance, in terms of its synchronization with its associated stack set.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINOPERABLE\fP : A \fBDeleteStackInstances\fP operation has failed and left the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from further \fBUpdateStackSet\fP operations. You might need to perform a \fBDeleteStackInstances\fP operation, with \fBRetainStacks\fP set to true, to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOUTDATED\fP : The stack isn\(aqt currently up to date with the stack set because either the associated stack failed during a \fBCreateStackSet\fP or \fBUpdateStackSet\fP operation, or the stack was part of a \fBCreateStackSet\fP or \fBUpdateStackSet\fP operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was created or updated.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCURRENT\fP : The stack is currently up to date with the stack set.

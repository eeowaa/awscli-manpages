.SH NAME
iam-create-service-linked-role \- Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific AWS service
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific AWS service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your AWS resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see \fI\%Using service\-linked roles\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
To attach a policy to this service\-linked role, you must make the request using the AWS service that depends on this role.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-aws\-service\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The service principal for the AWS service to which this role is attached. You use a string similar to a URL but without the \fI\%http://\fP in front. For example: \fBelasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com\fP .
.sp
Service principals are unique and case\-sensitive. To find the exact service principal for your service\-linked role, see \fI\%AWS services that work with IAM\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP . Look for the services that have \fBYes\fP in the \fBService\-Linked Role\fP column. Choose the \fBYes\fP link to view the service\-linked role documentation for that service.

.sp
\fB\-\-description\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The description of the role.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-custom\-suffix\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A string that you provide, which is combined with the service\-provided prefix to form the complete role name. If you make multiple requests for the same service, then you must supply a different \fBCustomSuffix\fP for each request. Otherwise the request fails with a duplicate role name error. For example, you could add \fB\-1\fP or \fB\-debug\fP to the suffix.
.sp
Some services do not support the \fBCustomSuffix\fP parameter. If you provide an optional suffix and the operation fails, try the operation again without the suffix.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

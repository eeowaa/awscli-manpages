ec2-describe-spot-fleet-request-history \- Describes the events for the specified Spot Fleet request during the specified time
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes the events for the specified Spot Fleet request during the specified time.
.sp
Spot Fleet events are delayed by up to 30 seconds before they can be described. This ensures that you can query by the last evaluated time and not miss a recorded event. Spot Fleet events are available for 48 hours.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \fBDryRunOperation\fP . Otherwise, it is \fBUnauthorizedOperation\fP .

\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of results to return in a single call. Specify a value between 1 and 1000. The default value is 1000. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned \fBNextToken\fP value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The token for the next set of results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-spot\-fleet\-request\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the Spot Fleet request.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-start\-time\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The starting date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example, \fIYYYY\fP \-\fIMM\fP \-\fIDD\fP T*HH* :\fIMM\fP :\fISS\fP Z).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

kinesis-list-stream-consumers \- Lists the consumers registered to receive data from a stream using enhanced fan-out, and provides information about each consumer
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists the consumers registered to receive data from a stream using enhanced fan\-out, and provides information about each consumer.
.sp
This operation has a limit of 5 transactions per second per stream.

\fBlist\-stream\-consumers\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBConsumers\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-stream\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the Kinesis data stream for which you want to list the registered consumers. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-stream\-creation\-timestamp\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specify this input parameter to distinguish data streams that have the same name. For example, if you create a data stream and then delete it, and you later create another data stream with the same name, you can use this input parameter to specify which of the two streams you want to list the consumers for.
.sp
You can\(aqt specify this parameter if you specify the NextToken parameter.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Consumers \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of JSON objects. Each object represents one registered consumer.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An object that represents the details of the consumer you registered. This type of object is returned by  RegisterStreamConsumer .
.sp
ConsumerName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the consumer is something you choose when you register the consumer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ConsumerARN \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates an ARN for it. You need this ARN to be able to call  SubscribeToShard .
.sp
If you delete a consumer and then create a new one with the same name, it won\(aqt have the same ARN. That\(aqs because consumer ARNs contain the creation timestamp. This is important to keep in mind if you have IAM policies that reference consumer ARNs.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ConsumerStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A consumer can\(aqt read data while in the \fBCREATING\fP or \fBDELETING\fP states.
.UNINDENT

.sp
ConsumerCreationTimestamp \-> (timestamp)

.UNINDENT

.sp
NextToken \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When the number of consumers that are registered with the data stream is greater than the default value for the \fBMaxResults\fP parameter, or if you explicitly specify a value for \fBMaxResults\fP that is less than the number of registered consumers, the response includes a pagination token named \fBNextToken\fP . You can specify this \fBNextToken\fP value in a subsequent call to \fBListStreamConsumers\fP to list the next set of registered consumers. For more information about the use of this pagination token when calling the \fBListStreamConsumers\fP operation, see  ListStreamConsumersInput$NextToken .
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Tokens expire after 300 seconds. When you obtain a value for \fBNextToken\fP in the response to a call to \fBListStreamConsumers\fP , you have 300 seconds to use that value. If you specify an expired token in a call to \fBListStreamConsumers\fP , you get \fBExpiredNextTokenException\fP .

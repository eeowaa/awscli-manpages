elasticbeanstalk-compose-environments \- Create or update a group of environments that each run a separate component of a single application
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Create or update a group of environments that each run a separate component of a single application. Takes a list of version labels that specify application source bundles for each of the environments to create or update. The name of each environment and other required information must be included in the source bundles in an environment manifest named \fBenv.yaml\fP . See \fI\%Compose Environments\fP for details.
.sp

\fB\-\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

\fB\-\-version\-labels\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of version labels, specifying one or more application source bundles that belong to the target application. Each source bundle must include an environment manifest that specifies the name of the environment and the name of the solution stack to use, and optionally can specify environment links to create.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

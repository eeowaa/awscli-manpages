.SH NAME
mturk-delete-qualification-type \- The DeleteQualificationType deletes a Qualification type and deletes any HIT types that are associated with the Qualification type
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBDeleteQualificationType\fP deletes a Qualification type and deletes any HIT types that are associated with the Qualification type.
.sp
This operation does not revoke Qualifications already assigned to Workers because the Qualifications might be needed for active HITs. If there are any pending requests for the Qualification type, Amazon Mechanical Turk rejects those requests. After you delete a Qualification type, you can no longer use it to create HITs or HIT types.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
DeleteQualificationType must wait for all the HITs that use the deleted Qualification type to be deleted before completing. It may take up to 48 hours before DeleteQualificationType completes and the unique name of the Qualification type is available for reuse with CreateQualificationType.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them into a specified order.
.sp
When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet\(aqs locations.
.sp
This operation can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet\(aqs home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.
.IP \(bu 2
To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet\(aqs home Region or any remote location.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
.sp
If successful, a \fBGameSession\fP object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in \fBACTIVE\fP status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use  DescribeGameSessions .
.sp
You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBgameSessionId\fP \-\- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a \fBGameSessionId\fP or \fBGameSessionArn\fP value.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBgameSessionName\fP \-\- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with  CreateGameSession or updating with  UpdateGameSession . Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBgameSessionProperties\fP \-\- Custom data defined in a game session\(aqs \fBGameProperty\fP parameter. \fBGameProperty\fP values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair "gameMode:brawl", specify the following: \fBgameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl"\fP . All custom data values are searched as strings.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmaximumSessions\fP \-\- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with  CreateGameSession or updating with  UpdateGameSession .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcreationTimeMillis\fP \-\- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBplayerSessionCount\fP \-\- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhasAvailablePlayerSessions\fP \-\- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.
.UNINDENT

\fBsearch\-game\-sessions\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBGameSessions\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-fleet\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-alias\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the alias associated with the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-location\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A fleet location to search for game sessions. You can specify a fleet\(aqs home Region or a remote location. Use the AWS Region code format, such as \fBus\-west\-2\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-filter\-expression\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in \fBACTIVE\fP status.
.sp
A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOperand\fP \-\- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are \fBgameSessionName\fP , \fBgameSessionId\fP , \fBgameSessionProperties\fP , \fBmaximumSessions\fP , \fBcreationTimeMillis\fP , \fBplayerSessionCount\fP , \fBhasAvailablePlayerSessions\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBComparator\fP \-\- Valid comparators are: \fB=\fP , \fB<>\fP , \fB<\fP , \fB>\fP , \fB<=\fP , \fB>=\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBValue\fP \-\- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators \fB=\fP and \fB<>\fP . For example, the following filter expression searches on \fBgameSessionName\fP : "\fBFilterExpression": "gameSessionName = \(aqMatt\e\e\(aqs Awesome Game 1\(aq"\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords \fBAND\fP , \fBOR\fP , and \fBNOT\fP and parentheses as needed. For example: \fBx AND y AND NOT z\fP , \fBNOT (x OR y)\fP .
.sp
Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB=\fP , \fB<>\fP , \fB<\fP , \fB>\fP , \fB<=\fP , \fB>=\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Parentheses
.IP \(bu 2
NOT
.IP \(bu 2
AND
.IP \(bu 2
OR
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: \fB"maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-sort\-expression\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following elements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOperand\fP \-\- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are \fBgameSessionName\fP , \fBgameSessionId\fP , \fBgameSessionProperties\fP , \fBmaximumSessions\fP , \fBcreationTimeMillis\fP , \fBplayerSessionCount\fP , \fBhasAvailablePlayerSessions\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOrder\fP \-\- Valid sort orders are \fBASC\fP (ascending) and \fBDESC\fP (descending).
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions first: \fB"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"\fP . Results with a null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

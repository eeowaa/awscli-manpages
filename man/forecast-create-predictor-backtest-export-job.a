.SH NAME
forecast-create-predictor-backtest-export-job \- Exports backtest forecasts and accuracy metrics generated by the  CreatePredictor operation
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Exports backtest forecasts and accuracy metrics generated by the  CreatePredictor operation. Two folders containing CSV files are exported to your specified S3 bucket.
.sp
The export file names will match the following conventions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB<ExportJobName>_<ExportTimestamp>_<PartNumber>.csv\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The <ExportTimestamp> component is in Java SimpleDate format (yyyy\-MM\-ddTHH\-mm\-ssZ).
.sp
You must specify a  DataDestination object that includes an Amazon S3 bucket and an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see  aws\-forecast\-iam\-roles .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBStatus\fP of the export job must be \fBACTIVE\fP before you can access the export in your Amazon S3 bucket. To get the status, use the  DescribePredictorBacktestExportJob operation.

.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor that you want to export.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-destination\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The destination for an export job. Provide an S3 path, an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Amazon Forecast to access the location, and an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key (optional).
.sp
S3Config \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket along with the credentials to access the bucket.
.sp
Path \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
RoleArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a value for the \fBKMSKeyArn\fP key, the role must allow access to the key.
.sp
Passing a role across AWS accounts is not allowed. If you pass a role that isn\(aqt in your account, you get an \fBInvalidInputException\fP error.

\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional metadata to help you categorize and organize your backtests. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
.sp
The following restrictions apply to tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For each resource, each tag key must be unique and each tag key must have one value.
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum number of tags per resource: 50.
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF\-8.
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF\-8.
.IP \(bu 2
Accepted characters: all letters and numbers, spaces representable in UTF\-8, and + \- = . _ : / @. If your tagging schema is used across other services and resources, the character restrictions of those services also apply.
.IP \(bu 2
Key prefixes cannot include any upper or lowercase combination of \fBaws:\fP or \fBAWS:\fP . Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has \fBaws\fP as its prefix but the key does not, Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of \fBaws\fP do not count against your tags per resource limit. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
.sp
The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum number of tags per resource \- 50.
.IP \(bu 2
For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum key length \- 128 Unicode characters in UTF\-8.
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum value length \- 256 Unicode characters in UTF\-8.
.IP \(bu 2
If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF\-8, and the following characters: + \- = . _ : / @.
.IP \(bu 2
Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
.IP \(bu 2
Do not use \fBaws:\fP , \fBAWS:\fP , or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has \fBaws\fP as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of \fBaws\fP do not count against your tags per resource limit.

Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
One part of a key\-value pair that makes up a tag. A \fBkey\fP is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The optional part of a key\-value pair that makes up a tag. A \fBvalue\fP acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

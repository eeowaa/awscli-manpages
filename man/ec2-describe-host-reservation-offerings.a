.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes the Dedicated Host reservations that are available to purchase.
.sp
The results describe all of the Dedicated Host reservation offerings, including offerings that might not match the instance family and Region of your Dedicated Hosts. When purchasing an offering, ensure that the instance family and Region of the offering matches that of the Dedicated Hosts with which it is to be associated. For more information about supported instance types, see \fI\%Dedicated Hosts\fP in the \fIAmazon EC2 User Guide\fP .

\fBdescribe\-host\-reservation\-offerings\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBOfferingSet\fP

\fB\-\-max\-duration\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This is the maximum duration of the reservation to purchase, specified in seconds. Reservations are available in one\-year and three\-year terms. The number of seconds specified must be the number of seconds in a year (365x24x60x60) times one of the supported durations (1 or 3). For example, specify 94608000 for three years.

\fB\-\-min\-duration\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This is the minimum duration of the reservation you\(aqd like to purchase, specified in seconds. Reservations are available in one\-year and three\-year terms. The number of seconds specified must be the number of seconds in a year (365x24x60x60) times one of the supported durations (1 or 3). For example, specify 31536000 for one year.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-offering\-id\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the reservation offering.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

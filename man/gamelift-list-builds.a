gamelift-list-builds \- Retrieves build resources for all builds associated with the AWS account in use
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves build resources for all builds associated with the AWS account in use. You can limit results to builds that are in a specific status by using the \fBStatus\fP parameter. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results in a set of sequential pages.

\fBlist\-builds\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBBuilds\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-status\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Build status to filter results by. To retrieve all builds, leave this parameter empty.
.sp
Possible build statuses include the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINITIALIZED\fP \-\- A new build has been defined, but no files have been uploaded. You cannot create fleets for builds that are in this status. When a build is successfully created, the build status is set to this value.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBREADY\fP \-\- The game build has been successfully uploaded. You can now create new fleets for this build.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP \-\- The game build upload failed. You cannot create new fleets for this build.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBExample1: To get a list of custom game builds\fP
.sp
The following \fBlist\-builds\fP example retrieves properties for all game server builds in the current Region. The sample request illustrates how to use the pagination parameters, \fBLimit\fP and \fBNextToken\fP, to retrieve the results in sequential sets. The first command retrieves the first two builds. Because there are more than two available, the response includes a \fBNextToken\fP to indicate that more results are available.

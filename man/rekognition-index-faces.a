.SH NAME
rekognition-index-faces \- Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.
.sp
Amazon Rekognition doesn\(aqt save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the  SearchFaces and  SearchFacesByImage operations.
.sp
For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
.sp
To get the number of faces in a collection, call  DescribeCollection .
.sp
If you\(aqre using version 1.0 of the face detection model, \fBIndexFaces\fP indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.
.sp
If you\(aqre using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the \fBOrientationCorrection\fP field.
.sp
To determine which version of the model you\(aqre using, call  DescribeCollection and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of \fBFaceModelVersion\fP in the response from \fBIndexFaces\fP
.sp
For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
.sp
If you provide the optional \fBExternalImageId\fP for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the  ListFaces operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client\-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image.
.sp
You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the \fBMaxFaces\fP input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don\(aqt want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background.
.sp
The \fBQualityFilter\fP input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, \fBIndexFaces\fP chooses the quality bar that\(aqs used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use \fBQualityFilter\fP , to set the quality bar by specifying \fBLOW\fP , \fBMEDIUM\fP , or \fBHIGH\fP . If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify \fBNONE\fP .
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call  DescribeCollection .

.sp
Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of  UnindexedFace objects, \fBUnindexedFaces\fP . Faces aren\(aqt indexed for reasons such as:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the \fBMaxFaces\fP request parameter.
.IP \(bu 2
The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.
.IP \(bu 2
The face is too blurry.
.IP \(bu 2
The image is too dark.
.IP \(bu 2
The face has an extreme pose.
.IP \(bu 2
The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In response, the \fBIndexFaces\fP operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, \fBFaceRecords\fP . This includes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The bounding box, \fBBoundingBox\fP , of the detected face.
.IP \(bu 2
A confidence value, \fBConfidence\fP , which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.
.IP \(bu 2
A face ID, \fBFaceId\fP , assigned by the service for each face that\(aqs detected and stored.
.IP \(bu 2
An image ID, \fBImageId\fP , assigned by the service for the input image.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you request all facial attributes (by using the \fBdetectionAttributes\fP parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the \fBIndexFaces\fP operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn\(aqt save duplicate face metadata.
.sp
The input image is passed either as base64\-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn\(aqt supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.
.sp
This operation requires permissions to perform the \fBrekognition:IndexFaces\fP action.

\fB\-\-detection\-attributes\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of facial attributes that you want to be returned. This can be the default list of attributes or all attributes. If you don\(aqt specify a value for \fBAttributes\fP or if you specify \fB["DEFAULT"]\fP , the API returns the following subset of facial attributes: \fBBoundingBox\fP , \fBConfidence\fP , \fBPose\fP , \fBQuality\fP , and \fBLandmarks\fP . If you provide \fB["ALL"]\fP , all facial attributes are returned, but the operation takes longer to complete.
.sp
If you provide both, \fB["ALL", "DEFAULT"]\fP , the service uses a logical AND operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all attributes).

\fB\-\-max\-faces\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of faces to index. The value of \fBMaxFaces\fP must be greater than or equal to 1. \fBIndexFaces\fP returns no more than 100 detected faces in an image, even if you specify a larger value for \fBMaxFaces\fP .
.sp
If \fBIndexFaces\fP detects more faces than the value of \fBMaxFaces\fP , the faces with the lowest quality are filtered out first. If there are still more faces than the value of \fBMaxFaces\fP , the faces with the smallest bounding boxes are filtered out (up to the number that\(aqs needed to satisfy the value of \fBMaxFaces\fP ). Information about the unindexed faces is available in the \fBUnindexedFaces\fP array.
.sp
The faces that are returned by \fBIndexFaces\fP are sorted by the largest face bounding box size to the smallest size, in descending order.

\fB\-\-quality\-filter\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to identify faces. Filtered faces aren\(aqt indexed. If you specify \fBAUTO\fP , Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify \fBLOW\fP , \fBMEDIUM\fP , or \fBHIGH\fP , filtering removes all faces that don’t meet the chosen quality bar. The default value is \fBAUTO\fP . The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low\-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that\(aqs misidentified as a face, a face that\(aqs too blurry, or a face with a pose that\(aqs too extreme to use. If you specify \fBNONE\fP , no filtering is performed.
.sp
To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.IP \(bu 2
If the input image is in .jpeg format, it might contain exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata that includes the image\(aqs orientation. Amazon Rekognition uses this orientation information to perform image correction \- the bounding box coordinates are translated to represent object locations after the orientation information in the Exif metadata is used to correct the image orientation. Images in .png format don\(aqt contain Exif metadata. The value of \fBOrientationCorrection\fP is null.
.IP \(bu 2
If the image doesn\(aqt contain orientation information in its Exif metadata, Amazon Rekognition returns an estimated orientation (ROTATE_0, ROTATE_90, ROTATE_180, ROTATE_270). Amazon Rekognition doesn’t perform image correction for images. The bounding box coordinates aren\(aqt translated and represent the object locations before the image is rotated.

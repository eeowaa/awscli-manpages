.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBCreateHITWithHITType\fP operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT) using an existing HITTypeID generated by the \fBCreateHITType\fP operation.
.sp
This is an alternative way to create HITs from the \fBCreateHIT\fP operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs.
.sp
CreateHITWithHITType also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the \fBQuestion\fP parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a \fBHitLayoutId\fP and associated \fBHitLayoutParameters\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-hit\-type\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The HIT type ID you want to create this HIT with.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-assignments\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of times the HIT can be accepted and completed before the HIT becomes unavailable.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-lifetime\-in\-seconds\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An amount of time, in seconds, after which the HIT is no longer available for users to accept. After the lifetime of the HIT elapses, the HIT no longer appears in HIT searches, even if not all of the assignments for the HIT have been accepted.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-question\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The data the person completing the HIT uses to produce the results.
.sp
Constraints: Must be a QuestionForm data structure, an ExternalQuestion data structure, or an HTMLQuestion data structure. The XML question data must not be larger than 64 kilobytes (65,535 bytes) in size, including whitespace.
.sp
Either a Question parameter or a HITLayoutId parameter must be provided.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-requester\-annotation\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An arbitrary data field. The RequesterAnnotation parameter lets your application attach arbitrary data to the HIT for tracking purposes. For example, this parameter could be an identifier internal to the Requester\(aqs application that corresponds with the HIT.
.sp
The RequesterAnnotation parameter for a HIT is only visible to the Requester who created the HIT. It is not shown to the Worker, or any other Requester.
.sp
The RequesterAnnotation parameter may be different for each HIT you submit. It does not affect how your HITs are grouped.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-unique\-request\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for this request which allows you to retry the call on error without creating duplicate HITs. This is useful in cases such as network timeouts where it is unclear whether or not the call succeeded on the server. If the HIT already exists in the system from a previous call using the same UniqueRequestToken, subsequent calls will return a AWS.MechanicalTurk.HitAlreadyExists error with a message containing the HITId.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Note: It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the token. The unique token expires after 24 hours. Subsequent calls using the same UniqueRequestToken made after the 24 hour limit could create duplicate HITs.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.

Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.INDENT 3.5
Conditions that a Worker\(aqs Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements.

The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Comparator \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification\(aqs value. You can compare a Qualification\(aqs value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\(aqs profile, regardless of its value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
IntegerValues \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The integer value to compare against the Qualification\(aqs value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure.

LocaleValues \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The locale value to compare against the Qualification\(aqs value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166\-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure.
.sp

RequiredToPreview \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
DEPRECATED: Use the \fBActionsGuarded\fP field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker\(aqs Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\(aqs question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the \fBActionsGuarded\fP field.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ActionsGuarded \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\(aqs possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the \fBRequiredToPreview\fP field.

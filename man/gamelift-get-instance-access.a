.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for debugging, gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity in real time.
.sp
To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system of the instance. For a Windows instance, GameLift returns a user name and password as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, GameLift returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client. The private key must be saved in the proper format to a \fB\&.pem\fP file before using. If you\(aqre making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret can be handled as part of the \fBGetInstanceAccess\fP request, as shown in one of the examples for this operation.
.sp
To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the instance and the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve a fleet\(aqs instance IDs by calling  DescribeInstances . If successful, an  InstanceAccess object is returned that contains the instance\(aqs IP address and a set of credentials.

.sp
\fB\-\-fleet\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the fleet that contains the instance you want access to. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. The fleet can be in any of the following statuses: \fBACTIVATING\fP , \fBACTIVE\fP , or \fBERROR\fP . Fleets with an \fBERROR\fP status may be accessible for a short time before they are deleted.

\fB\-\-instance\-id\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the instance you want to get access to. You can access an instance in any status.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

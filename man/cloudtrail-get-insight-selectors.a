cloudtrail-get-insight-selectors \- Describes the settings for the Insights event selectors that you configured for your trail
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes the settings for the Insights event selectors that you configured for your trail. \fBGetInsightSelectors\fP shows if CloudTrail Insights event logging is enabled on the trail, and if it is, which insight types are enabled. If you run \fBGetInsightSelectors\fP on a trail that does not have Insights events enabled, the operation throws the exception \fBInsightNotEnabledException\fP
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Logging CloudTrail Insights Events for Trails\fP in the \fIAWS CloudTrail User Guide\fP .

.IP \(bu 2
Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

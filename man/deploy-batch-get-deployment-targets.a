.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns an array of one or more targets associated with a deployment. This method works with all compute types and should be used instead of the deprecated \fBBatchGetDeploymentInstances\fP . The maximum number of targets that can be returned is 25.
.sp
The type of targets returned depends on the deployment\(aqs compute platform or deployment method:

.sp
\fB\-\-target\-ids\fP (list)

.IP \(bu 2
For deployments that use the EC2/On\-premises compute platform, the target IDs are EC2 or on\-premises instances IDs, and their target type is \fBinstanceTarget\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
For deployments that use the AWS Lambda compute platform, the target IDs are the names of Lambda functions, and their target type is \fBinstanceTarget\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
For deployments that use the Amazon ECS compute platform, the target IDs are pairs of Amazon ECS clusters and services specified using the format \fB<clustername>:<servicename>\fP . Their target type is \fBecsTarget\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
For deployments that are deployed with AWS CloudFormation, the target IDs are CloudFormation stack IDs. Their target type is \fBcloudFormationTarget\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the properties for one or more game session queues. When requesting multiple queues, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a  GameSessionQueue object is returned for each requested queue. When specifying a list of queues, objects are returned only for queues that currently exist in the Region.

\fBdescribe\-game\-session\-queues\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBGameSessionQueues\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GameSessionQueueArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (\fI\%ARN\fP ) that is assigned to a GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is \fBarn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name>\fP . In a GameLift game session queue ARN, the resource ID matches the \fIName\fP value.

.sp
TimeoutInSeconds \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement changes to a \fBTIMED_OUT\fP status.

.sp
PlayerLatencyPolicies \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A set of policies that act as a sliding cap on player latency. FleetIQ works to deliver low latency for most players in a game session. These policies ensure that no individual player can be placed into a game with unreasonably high latency. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are applied based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing a game session. With a latency policy in force, a game session cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are used only with placement request that provide player latency information. Player latency policies can be stacked to gradually relax latency requirements over time.
.sp
Latency policies are part of a  GameSessionQueue .
.sp
MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PolicyDurationSeconds \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

.sp
DestinationArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0

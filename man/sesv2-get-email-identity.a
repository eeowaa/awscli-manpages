.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-email\-identity\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The email identity that you want to retrieve details for.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH OUTPUT
.sp
IdentityType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The email identity type.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
FeedbackForwardingStatus \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The feedback forwarding configuration for the identity.
.sp
If the value is \fBtrue\fP , you receive email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. These notifications are sent to the address that you specified in the \fBReturn\-Path\fP header of the original email.
.sp
You\(aqre required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints. If you haven\(aqt set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications (for example, by setting up an event destination), you receive an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
VerifiedForSendingStatus \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies whether or not the identity is verified. You can only send email from verified email addresses or domains. For more information about verifying identities, see the \fI\%Amazon Pinpoint User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
DkimAttributes \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An object that contains information about the DKIM attributes for the identity.
.sp
SigningEnabled \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the value is \fBtrue\fP , then the messages that you send from the identity are signed using DKIM. If the value is \fBfalse\fP , then the messages that you send from the identity aren\(aqt DKIM\-signed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Describes whether or not Amazon SES has successfully located the DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The status can be one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPENDING\fP – The verification process was initiated, but Amazon SES hasn\(aqt yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSUCCESS\fP – The verification process completed successfully.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP – The verification process failed. This typically occurs when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS configuration of the domain.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBTEMPORARY_FAILURE\fP – A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBNOT_STARTED\fP – The DKIM verification process hasn\(aqt been initiated for the domain.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Tokens \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you used \fI\%Easy DKIM\fP to configure DKIM authentication for the domain, then this object contains a set of unique strings that you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS configuration for your domain. When Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain, the DKIM authentication process is complete.
.sp
If you configured DKIM authentication for the domain by providing your own public\-private key pair, then this object contains the selector for the public key.
.sp
Regardless of the DKIM authentication method you use, Amazon SES searches for the appropriate records in the DNS configuration of the domain for up to 72 hours.
.sp
(string)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SigningAttributesOrigin \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A string that indicates how DKIM was configured for the identity. There are two possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAWS_SES\fP – Indicates that DKIM was configured for the identity by using \fI\%Easy DKIM\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEXTERNAL\fP – Indicates that DKIM was configured for the identity by using Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM).

.sp
MailFromAttributes \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An object that contains information about the Mail\-From attributes for the email identity.
.sp
MailFromDomain \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of a domain that an email identity uses as a custom MAIL FROM domain.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MailFromDomainStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the MAIL FROM domain. This status can have the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPENDING\fP – Amazon SES hasn\(aqt started searching for the MX record yet.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSUCCESS\fP – Amazon SES detected the required MX record for the MAIL FROM domain.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP – Amazon SES can\(aqt find the required MX record, or the record no longer exists.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBTEMPORARY_FAILURE\fP – A temporary issue occurred, which prevented Amazon SES from determining the status of the MAIL FROM domain.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
BehaviorOnMxFailure \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The action that you want to take if the required MX record can\(aqt be found when you send an email. When you set this value to \fBUseDefaultValue\fP , the mail is sent using \fIamazonses.com\fP as the MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to \fBRejectMessage\fP , the Amazon SES API v2 returns a \fBMailFromDomainNotVerified\fP error, and doesn\(aqt attempt to deliver the email.
.sp
These behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain configuration is in the \fBPending\fP , \fBFailed\fP , and \fBTemporaryFailure\fP states.

Tags \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that are associated with the email identity.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A \fItag\fP is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.
.sp
Each tag consists of a required \fItag key\fP and an associated \fItag value\fP , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + \-. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
.IP \(bu 2
For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBaws:\fP prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can\(aqt edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource.
.IP \(bu 2
You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

If you don\(aqt want a resource to have a specific tag value, don\(aqt specify a value for this parameter. If you don\(aqt specify a value, Amazon SES sets the value to an empty string.

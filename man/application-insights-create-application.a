\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
List of tags to add to the application. tag key (\fBKey\fP ) and an associated tag value (\fBValue\fP ). The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An object that defines the tags associated with an application. A \fItag\fP is a label that you optionally define and associate with an application. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.
.sp
Each tag consists of a required \fItag key\fP and an associated \fItag value\fP , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + \-. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
.IP \(bu 2
For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBaws:\fP prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can\(aqt edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

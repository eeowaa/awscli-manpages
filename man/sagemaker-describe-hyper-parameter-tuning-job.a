.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
If you choose \fBManifestFile\fP , \fBS3Uri\fP identifies an object that is a manifest file containing a list of object keys that you want Amazon SageMaker to use for model training.
.sp
If you choose \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP , S3Uri identifies an object that is an augmented manifest file in JSON lines format. This file contains the data you want to use for model training. \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP can only be used if the Channel\(aqs input mode is \fBPipe\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
S3Uri \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Depending on the value specified for the \fBS3DataType\fP , identifies either a key name prefix or a manifest. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A key name prefix might look like this: \fBs3://bucketname/exampleprefix\fP
.IP \(bu 2
A manifest might look like this: \fBs3://bucketname/example.manifest\fP   A manifest is an S3 object which is a JSON file consisting of an array of elements. The first element is a prefix which is followed by one or more suffixes. SageMaker appends the suffix elements to the prefix to get a full set of \fBS3Uri\fP . Note that the prefix must be a valid non\-empty \fBS3Uri\fP that precludes users from specifying a manifest whose individual \fBS3Uri\fP is sourced from different S3 buckets. The following code example shows a valid manifest format:   \fB[ {"prefix": "s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/"},\fP    \fB"relative/path/to/custdata\-1",\fP    \fB"relative/path/custdata\-2",\fP    \fB\&...\fP    \fB"relative/path/custdata\-N"\fP    \fB]\fP   This JSON is equivalent to the following \fBS3Uri\fP list:  \fBs3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/to/custdata\-1\fP    \fBs3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata\-2\fP    \fB\&...\fP    \fBs3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata\-N\fP   The complete set of \fBS3Uri\fP in this manifest is the input data for the channel for this data source. The object that each \fBS3Uri\fP points to must be readable by the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker uses to perform tasks on your behalf.

.UNINDENT
.sp
S3DataDistributionType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you want Amazon SageMaker to replicate the entire dataset on each ML compute instance that is launched for model training, specify \fBFullyReplicated\fP .
.sp
If you want Amazon SageMaker to replicate a subset of data on each ML compute instance that is launched for model training, specify \fBShardedByS3Key\fP . If there are \fIn\fP ML compute instances launched for a training job, each instance gets approximately 1/\fIn\fP of the number of S3 objects. In this case, model training on each machine uses only the subset of training data.
.sp
Don\(aqt choose more ML compute instances for training than available S3 objects. If you do, some nodes won\(aqt get any data and you will pay for nodes that aren\(aqt getting any training data. This applies in both File and Pipe modes. Keep this in mind when developing algorithms.
.sp
In distributed training, where you use multiple ML compute EC2 instances, you might choose \fBShardedByS3Key\fP . If the algorithm requires copying training data to the ML storage volume (when \fBTrainingInputMode\fP is set to \fBFile\fP ), this copies 1/\fIn\fP of the number of objects.

Use this parameter to override the \fBTrainingInputMode\fP setting in a  AlgorithmSpecification request when you have a channel that needs a different input mode from the training job\(aqs general setting. To download the data from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to the provisioned ML storage volume, and mount the directory to a Docker volume, use \fBFile\fP input mode. To stream data directly from Amazon S3 to the container, choose \fBPipe\fP input mode.

ShuffleConfig \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A configuration for a shuffle option for input data in a channel. If you use \fBS3Prefix\fP for \fBS3DataType\fP , this shuffles the results of the S3 key prefix matches. If you use \fBManifestFile\fP , the order of the S3 object references in the \fBManifestFile\fP is shuffled. If you use \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP , the order of the JSON lines in the \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP is shuffled. The shuffling order is determined using the \fBSeed\fP value.
.sp
For Pipe input mode, shuffling is done at the start of every epoch. With large datasets this ensures that the order of the training data is different for each epoch, it helps reduce bias and possible overfitting. In a multi\-node training job when ShuffleConfig is combined with \fBS3DataDistributionType\fP of \fBShardedByS3Key\fP , the data is shuffled across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch might be sent to a different node on the second epoch.

ShuffleConfig \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A configuration for a shuffle option for input data in a channel. If you use \fBS3Prefix\fP for \fBS3DataType\fP , this shuffles the results of the S3 key prefix matches. If you use \fBManifestFile\fP , the order of the S3 object references in the \fBManifestFile\fP is shuffled. If you use \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP , the order of the JSON lines in the \fBAugmentedManifestFile\fP is shuffled. The shuffling order is determined using the \fBSeed\fP value.
.sp
For Pipe input mode, shuffling is done at the start of every epoch. With large datasets this ensures that the order of the training data is different for each epoch, it helps reduce bias and possible overfitting. In a multi\-node training job when ShuffleConfig is combined with \fBS3DataDistributionType\fP of \fBShardedByS3Key\fP , the data is shuffled across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch might be sent to a different node on the second epoch.

If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your master key, the Amazon SageMaker execution role must include permissions to call \fBkms:Encrypt\fP . If you don\(aqt provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role\(aqs account. Amazon SageMaker uses server\-side encryption with KMS\-managed keys for \fBOutputDataConfig\fP .

The new hyperparameter tuning job can include input data, hyperparameter ranges, maximum number of concurrent training jobs, and maximum number of training jobs that are different than those of its parent hyperparameter tuning jobs. The training image can also be a different version from the version used in the parent hyperparameter tuning job. You can also change hyperparameters from tunable to static, and from static to tunable, but the total number of static plus tunable hyperparameters must remain the same as it is in all parent jobs. The objective metric for the new tuning job must be the same as for all parent jobs.

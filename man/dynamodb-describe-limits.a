.SH NAME
dynamodb-describe-limits \- Returns the current provisioned-capacity quotas for your AWS account in a Region, both for the Region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table that you create there
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns the current provisioned\-capacity quotas for your AWS account in a Region, both for the Region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table that you create there.
.sp
When you establish an AWS account, the account has initial quotas on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units that you can provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given Region. Also, there are per\-table quotas that apply when you create a table there. For more information, see \fI\%Service, Account, and Table Quotas\fP page in the \fIAmazon DynamoDB Developer Guide\fP .
.sp
Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at \fI\%AWS Support Center\fP , obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The \fBDescribeLimits\fP action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota.
.sp
For example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to do the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Call \fBDescribeLimits\fP for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there.
.IP \(bu 2
Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.
.IP \(bu 2
Call \fBListTables\fP to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.
.IP \(bu 2
For each table name listed by \fBListTables\fP , do the following:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
Call \fBDescribeTable\fP with the table name.
.IP \(bu 2
Use the data returned by \fBDescribeTable\fP to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your variables.
.IP \(bu 2
If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Report the account quotas for that Region returned by \fBDescribeLimits\fP , along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have calculated.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account\-level quotas.
.sp
The per\-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary indexes.
.sp
For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn\(aqt let you increase provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per\-account quotas.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

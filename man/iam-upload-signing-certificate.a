.SH NAME
iam-upload-signing-certificate \- Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified IAM user
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified IAM user. Some AWS services require you to use certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is \fBActive\fP .
.sp
For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate, see \fI\%Managing server certificates in IAM\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .
.sp
If the \fBUserName\fP is not specified, the IAM user name is determined implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the AWS account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage AWS account root user credentials even if the AWS account has no associated users.

Because the body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling \fBUploadSigningCertificate\fP . For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see \fI\%Signing AWS API requests\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP . For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see \fI\%Making query requests\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-user\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the user the signing certificate is for.
.sp
This parameter allows (through its \fI\%regex pattern\fP ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@\-
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-certificate\-body\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The contents of the signing certificate.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\fB\eu0020\fP ) through the end of the ASCII character range
.IP \(bu 2
The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin\-1 Supplement character set (through \fB\eu00FF\fP )
.IP \(bu 2
The special characters tab (\fB\eu0009\fP ), line feed (\fB\eu000A\fP ), and carriage return (\fB\eu000D\fP )

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Inserts or deletes  ActivatedRule objects in a \fBWebACL\fP . Each \fBRule\fP identifies web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. When you update a \fBWebACL\fP , you specify the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A default action for the \fBWebACL\fP , either \fBALLOW\fP or \fBBLOCK\fP . AWS WAF performs the default action if a request doesn\(aqt match the criteria in any of the \fBRules\fP in a \fBWebACL\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBRules\fP that you want to add or delete. If you want to replace one \fBRule\fP with another, you delete the existing \fBRule\fP and add the new one.
.IP \(bu 2
For each \fBRule\fP , whether you want AWS WAF to allow requests, block requests, or count requests that match the conditions in the \fBRule\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
The order in which you want AWS WAF to evaluate the \fBRules\fP in a \fBWebACL\fP . If you add more than one \fBRule\fP to a \fBWebACL\fP , AWS WAF evaluates each request against the \fBRules\fP in order based on the value of \fBPriority\fP . (The \fBRule\fP that has the lowest value for \fBPriority\fP is evaluated first.) When a web request matches all the predicates (such as \fBByteMatchSets\fP and \fBIPSets\fP ) in a \fBRule\fP , AWS WAF immediately takes the corresponding action, allow or block, and doesn\(aqt evaluate the request against the remaining \fBRules\fP in the \fBWebACL\fP , if any.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To create and configure a \fBWebACL\fP , perform the following steps:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Create and update the predicates that you want to include in \fBRules\fP . For more information, see  CreateByteMatchSet ,  UpdateByteMatchSet ,  CreateIPSet ,  UpdateIPSet ,  CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet , and  UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet .
.IP \(bu 2
Create and update the \fBRules\fP that you want to include in the \fBWebACL\fP . For more information, see  CreateRule and  UpdateRule .
.IP \(bu 2
Create a \fBWebACL\fP . See  CreateWebACL .
.IP \(bu 2
Use \fBGetChangeToken\fP to get the change token that you provide in the \fBChangeToken\fP parameter of an  UpdateWebACL request.
.IP \(bu 2
Submit an \fBUpdateWebACL\fP request to specify the \fBRules\fP that you want to include in the \fBWebACL\fP , to specify the default action, and to associate the \fBWebACL\fP with a CloudFront distribution.  The \fBActivatedRule\fP can be a rule group. If you specify a rule group as your \fBActivatedRule\fP , you can exclude specific rules from that rule group. If you already have a rule group associated with a web ACL and want to submit an \fBUpdateWebACL\fP request to exclude certain rules from that rule group, you must first remove the rule group from the web ACL, the re\-insert it again, specifying the excluded rules. For details, see  ActivatedRule$ExcludedRules .
.UNINDENT
.sp
Be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the rule type when first creating the rule, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule (the default rule type) with the specified ID, which does not exist.

.INDENT 3.5
The \fBActivatedRule\fP object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a \fBRule\fP that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the \fBRule\fP in the \fBWebACL\fP , and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the \fBRule\fP (\fBALLOW\fP , \fBBLOCK\fP , or \fBCOUNT\fP ).
.sp
Priority \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the order in which the \fBRules\fP in a \fBWebACL\fP are evaluated. Rules with a lower value for \fBPriority\fP are evaluated before \fBRules\fP with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple \fBRules\fP to a \fBWebACL\fP , the values don\(aqt need to be consecutive.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBALLOW\fP : CloudFront responds with the requested object.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBLOCK\fP : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.

\fBActivatedRule|OverrideAction\fP applies only when updating or adding a \fBRuleGroup\fP to a \fBWebACL\fP . In this case, you do not use \fBActivatedRule|Action\fP . For all other update requests, \fBActivatedRule|Action\fP is used instead of \fBActivatedRule|OverrideAction\fP .

OverrideAction \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use the \fBOverrideAction\fP to test your \fBRuleGroup\fP .
.sp
Any rule in a \fBRuleGroup\fP can potentially block a request. If you set the \fBOverrideAction\fP to \fBNone\fP , the \fBRuleGroup\fP will block a request if any individual rule in the \fBRuleGroup\fP matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the \fBRuleGroup\fP , set the \fBOverrideAction\fP to \fBCount\fP . The \fBRuleGroup\fP will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using  GetSampledRequests .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBActivatedRule|OverrideAction\fP applies only when updating or adding a \fBRuleGroup\fP to a \fBWebACL\fP . In this case you do not use \fBActivatedRule|Action\fP . For all other update requests, \fBActivatedRule|Action\fP is used instead of \fBActivatedRule|OverrideAction\fP .

.INDENT 3.5
The rule type, either \fBREGULAR\fP , as defined by  Rule , \fBRATE_BASED\fP , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or \fBGROUP\fP , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ExcludedRules \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the \fBActivatedRule\fP refers to a \fBRuleGroup\fP .
.sp
Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.
.sp
Specifying \fBExcludedRules\fP does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to \fBCOUNT\fP . Therefore, requests that match an \fBExcludedRule\fP are counted but not blocked. The \fBRuleGroup\fP owner will receive COUNT metrics for each \fBExcludedRule\fP .
.sp
If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see \fI\%Logging Web ACL Traffic Information\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the  UpdateWebACL request, the first \fBUpdates:Action\fP should be \fBDELETE\fP and \fBUpdates:ActivatedRule:RuleId\fP should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.
.IP \(bu 2
The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second \fBUpdates:Action\fP should be \fBINSERT\fP , \fBUpdates:ActivatedRule:RuleId\fP should be the rule group that you just removed, and \fBExcludedRules\fP should contain the rules that you want to exclude.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.

\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

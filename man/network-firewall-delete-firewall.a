.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified  Firewall and its  FirewallStatus . This operation requires the firewall\(aqs \fBDeleteProtection\fP flag to be \fBFALSE\fP . You can\(aqt revert this operation.
.sp
You can check whether a firewall is in use by reviewing the route tables for the Availability Zones where you have firewall subnet mappings. Retrieve the subnet mappings by calling  DescribeFirewall . You define and update the route tables through Amazon VPC. As needed, update the route tables for the zones to remove the firewall endpoints. When the route tables no longer use the firewall endpoints, you can remove the firewall safely.
.sp
To delete a firewall, remove the delete protection if you need to using  UpdateFirewallDeleteProtection , then delete the firewall by calling  DeleteFirewall .

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
The status of the firewall, for example whether it\(aqs ready to filter network traffic, is provided in the corresponding  FirewallStatus . You can retrieve both objects by calling  DescribeFirewall .

DeleteProtection \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A setting of \fBTRUE\fP indicates that the firewall is protected against deletion. Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this flag to \fBTRUE\fP .
.UNINDENT

You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource.
.sp
Key \-> (string)

FirewallStatus \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Detailed information about the current status of a  Firewall . You can retrieve this for a firewall by calling  DescribeFirewall and providing the firewall name and ARN.
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The readiness of the configured firewall to handle network traffic across all of the Availability Zones where you\(aqve configured it. This setting is \fBREADY\fP only when the \fBConfigurationSyncStateSummary\fP value is \fBIN_SYNC\fP and the \fBAttachment\fP  \fBStatus\fP values for all of the configured subnets are \fBREADY\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ConfigurationSyncStateSummary \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The configuration sync state for the firewall. This summarizes the sync states reported in the \fBConfig\fP settings for all of the Availability Zones where you have configured the firewall.
.sp
When you create a firewall or update its configuration, for example by adding a rule group to its firewall policy, Network Firewall distributes the configuration changes to all zones where the firewall is in use. This summary indicates whether the configuration changes have been applied everywhere.
.sp
This status must be \fBIN_SYNC\fP for the firewall to be ready for use, but it doesn\(aqt indicate that the firewall is ready. The \fBStatus\fP setting indicates firewall readiness.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SyncStates \-> (map)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The subnets that you\(aqve configured for use by the Network Firewall firewall. This contains one array element per Availability Zone where you\(aqve configured a subnet. These objects provide details of the information that is summarized in the \fBConfigurationSyncStateSummary\fP and \fBStatus\fP , broken down by zone and configuration object.
.sp
key \-> (string)
.sp
value \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy configuration for a single VPC subnet.
.sp
For each VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, AWS Network Firewall does the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the subnet, ready to take traffic.
.IP \(bu 2
Configures the endpoint with the current firewall policy settings, to provide the filtering behavior for the endpoint.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When you update a firewall, for example to add a subnet association or change a rule group in the firewall policy, the affected sync states reflect out\-of\-sync or not ready status until the changes are complete.
.sp
Attachment \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The attachment status of the firewall\(aqs association with a single VPC subnet. For each configured subnet, Network Firewall creates the attachment by instantiating the firewall endpoint in the subnet so that it\(aqs ready to take traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .
.sp
SubnetId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier of the subnet that you\(aqve specified to be used for a firewall endpoint.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EndpointId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The identifier of the firewall endpoint that Network Firewall has instantiated in the subnet. You use this to identify the firewall endpoint in the VPC route tables, when you redirect the VPC traffic through the endpoint.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The current status of the firewall endpoint in the subnet. This value reflects both the instantiation of the endpoint in the VPC subnet and the sync states that are reported in the \fBConfig\fP settings. When this value is \fBREADY\fP , the endpoint is available and configured properly to handle network traffic. When the endpoint isn\(aqt available for traffic, this value will reflect its state, for example \fBCREATING\fP , \fBDELETING\fP , or \fBFAILED\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Config \-> (map)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The configuration status of the firewall endpoint in a single VPC subnet. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .
.sp
key \-> (string)
.sp
value \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Provides configuration status for a single policy or rule group that is used for a firewall endpoint. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of a  SyncState for a firewall.
.sp
SyncStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Indicates whether this object is in sync with the version indicated in the update token.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

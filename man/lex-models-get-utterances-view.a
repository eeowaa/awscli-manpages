.SH NAME
lex-models-get-utterances-view \- Use the GetUtterancesView operation to get information about the utterances that your users have made to your bot
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Use the \fBGetUtterancesView\fP operation to get information about the utterances that your users have made to your bot. You can use this list to tune the utterances that your bot responds to.
.sp
For example, say that you have created a bot to order flowers. After your users have used your bot for a while, use the \fBGetUtterancesView\fP operation to see the requests that they have made and whether they have been successful. You might find that the utterance "I want flowers" is not being recognized. You could add this utterance to the \fBOrderFlowers\fP intent so that your bot recognizes that utterance.
.sp
After you publish a new version of a bot, you can get information about the old version and the new so that you can compare the performance across the two versions.
.sp
Utterance statistics are generated once a day. Data is available for the last 15 days. You can request information for up to 5 versions of your bot in each request. Amazon Lex returns the most frequent utterances received by the bot in the last 15 days. The response contains information about a maximum of 100 utterances for each version.
.sp
If you set \fBchildDirected\fP field to true when you created your bot, or if you opted out of participating in improving Amazon Lex, utterances are not available.
.sp
This operation requires permissions for the \fBlex:GetUtterancesView\fP action.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This operation returns a list of the canaries in your account, along with full details about each canary.
.sp
This operation does not have resource\-level authorization, so if a user is able to use \fBDescribeCanaries\fP , the user can see all of the canaries in the account. A deny policy can only be used to restrict access to all canaries. It cannot be used on specific resources.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token that indicates that there is more data available. You can use this token in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specify this parameter to limit how many canaries are returned each time you use the \fBDescribeCanaries\fP operation. If you omit this parameter, the default of 100 is used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

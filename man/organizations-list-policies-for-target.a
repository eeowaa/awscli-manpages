.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists the policies that are directly attached to the specified target root, organizational unit (OU), or account. You must specify the policy type that you want included in the returned list.

\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Always check the \fBNextToken\fP response parameter for a \fBnull\fP value when calling a \fBList*\fP operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The \fBNextToken\fP response parameter value is \fBnull\fP  \fIonly\fP when there are no more results to display.

.sp
This operation can be called only from the organization\(aqs management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.
.sp

See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.sp
\fBlist\-policies\-for\-target\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBPolicies\fP

\fB\-\-target\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier (ID) of the root, organizational unit, or account whose policies you want to list.
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP for a target ID string requires one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRoot\fP \- A string that begins with "r\-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAccount\fP \- A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOrganizational unit (OU)\fP \- A string that begins with "ou\-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "\-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

\fB\-\-filter\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of policy that you want to include in the returned list. You must specify one of the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%BACKUP_POLICY\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo retrieve a list of the SCPs attached directly to an account\fP
.sp
The following example shows how to get a list of all service control policies (SCPs), as specified by the Filter parameter, that are directly attached to an account:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws organizations list\-policies\-for\-target \-\-filter SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY \-\-target\-id 444444444444
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The output includes a list of policy structures with summary information about the policies. The list does not include policies that apply to the account because of inheritance from its location in an OU hierarchy:

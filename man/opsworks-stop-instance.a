.SH NAME
opsworks-stop-instance \- Stops a specified instance
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
Specifies whether to force an instance to stop. If the instance\(aqs root device type is \fBebs\fP , or EBS\-backed, adding the \fBForce\fP parameter to the \fBStopInstances\fP API call disassociates the AWS OpsWorks Stacks instance from EC2, and forces deletion of \fIonly\fP the OpsWorks Stacks instance. You must also delete the formerly\-associated instance in EC2 after troubleshooting and replacing the AWS OpsWorks Stacks instance with a new one.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

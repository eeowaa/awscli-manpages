.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
After AWS IoT Events starts analyzing your detector model, you have up to 24 hours to retrieve the analysis results.

.sp
\fB\-\-analysis\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the analysis result that you want to retrieve.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The token that you can use to return the next set of results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of results to be returned per request.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
analysisResults \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains information about one or more analysis results.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains the result of the analysis.
.sp
type \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of the analysis result. Analyses fall into the following types based on the validators used to generate the analysis result:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsupported\-actions\fP \- You must specify AWS IoT Events supported actions that work with other AWS services in a supported AWS Region.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBservice\-limits\fP \- Resources or API operations can\(aqt exceed service quotas (also known as limits). Update your detector model or request a quota increase.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstructure\fP \- The detector model must follow a structure that AWS IoT Events supports.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBexpression\-syntax\fP \- Your expression must follow the required syntax.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdata\-type\fP \- Data types referenced in the detector model must be compatible.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBreferenced\-data\fP \- You must define the data referenced in your detector model before you can use the data.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBreferenced\-resource\fP \- Resources that the detector model uses must be available.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
level \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The severity level of the analysis result. Based on the severity level, analysis results fall into three general categories:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINFO\fP \- An information result tells you about a significant field in your detector model. This type of result usually doesn\(aqt require immediate action.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBWARNING\fP \- A warning result draws special attention to fields that might cause issues for your detector model. We recommend that you review warnings and take necessary actions before you use your detector model in production environments. Otherwise, the detector model might not work as expected.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBERROR\fP \- An error result notifies you about a problem found in your detector model. You must fix all errors before you can publish your detector model.

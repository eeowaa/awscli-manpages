Sends you notification through CloudWatch Events when all files written to your file share have been uploaded to Amazon S3.
.sp
AWS Storage Gateway can send a notification through Amazon CloudWatch Events when all files written to your file share up to that point in time have been uploaded to Amazon S3. These files include files written to the file share up to the time that you make a request for notification. When the upload is done, Storage Gateway sends you notification through an Amazon CloudWatch Event. You can configure CloudWatch Events to send the notification through event targets such as Amazon SNS or AWS Lambda function. This operation is only supported for file gateways.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

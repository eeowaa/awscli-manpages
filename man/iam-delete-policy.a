.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified managed policy.
.sp
Before you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to. In addition, you must delete all the policy\(aqs versions. The following steps describe the process for deleting a managed policy:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, using  DetachUserPolicy ,  DetachGroupPolicy , or  DetachRolePolicy . To list all the users, groups, and roles that a policy is attached to, use  ListEntitiesForPolicy .
.IP \(bu 2
Delete all versions of the policy using  DeletePolicyVersion . To list the policy\(aqs versions, use  ListPolicyVersions . You cannot use  DeletePolicyVersion to delete the version that is marked as the default version. You delete the policy\(aqs default version in the next step of the process.
.IP \(bu 2
Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy\(aqs default version) using this operation.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-policy\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy you want to delete.
.sp
For more information about ARNs, see \fI\%Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)\fP in the \fIAWS General Reference\fP .
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves information about a fleet\(aqs instances, including instance IDs, connection data, and status.
.sp
This operation can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To get information on all instances that are deployed to a fleet\(aqs home Region, provide the fleet ID.
.IP \(bu 2
To get information on all instances that are deployed to a fleet\(aqs remote location, provide the fleet ID and location name.
.IP \(bu 2
To get information on a specific instance in a fleet, provide the fleet ID and instance ID.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
.sp
If successful, an \fBInstance\fP object is returned for each requested instance. Instances are not returned in any particular order.

\fBdescribe\-instances\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBInstances\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-fleet\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve instance information for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-instance\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for an instance to retrieve. Specify an instance ID or leave blank to retrieve all instances in the fleet.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-location\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of a location to retrieve instance information for, in the form of an AWS Region code such as \fBus\-west\-2\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

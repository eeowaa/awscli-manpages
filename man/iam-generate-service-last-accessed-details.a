.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Generates a report that includes details about when an IAM resource (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an attempt to access AWS services. Recent activity usually appears within four hours. IAM reports activity for the last 365 days, or less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year. For more information, see \fI\%Regions where data is tracked\fP .
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The service last accessed data includes all attempts to access an AWS API, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the AWS Management Console, the AWS API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that your account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see \fI\%Logging IAM events with CloudTrail\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

The \fBGenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails\fP operation returns a \fBJobId\fP . Use this parameter in the following operations to retrieve the following details from your report:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
GetServiceLastAccessedDetails – Use this operation for users, groups, roles, or policies to list every AWS service that the resource could access using permissions policies. For each service, the response includes information about the most recent access attempt. The \fBJobId\fP returned by \fBGenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail\fP must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call \fBGetServiceLastAccessedDetail\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities – Use this operation for groups and policies to list information about the associated entities (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific AWS service.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To check the status of the \fBGenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails\fP request, use the \fBJobId\fP parameter in the same operations and test the \fBJobStatus\fP response parameter.
.sp
For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an identity (user, group, or role) to access specific services, use the  ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess operation.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource\-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and AWS STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see \fI\%Evaluating policies\fP in the \fIIAM User Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the IAM resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) used to generate information about when the resource was last used in an attempt to access an AWS service.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-granularity\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The level of detail that you want to generate. You can specify whether you want to generate information about the last attempt to access services or actions. If you specify service\-level granularity, this operation generates only service data. If you specify action\-level granularity, it generates service and action data. If you don\(aqt include this optional parameter, the operation generates service data.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBTo generate a service access report\fP
.sp
The following \fBgenerate\-service\-last\-accessed\-details\fP example starts a background job to generate a report that lists the services accessed by IAM users and other entities with a custom policy named \fBintern\-boundary\fP\&. You can display the report after it is created by running the \fBget\-service\-last\-accessed\-details\fP command.

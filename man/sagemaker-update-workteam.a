.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-workteam\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the work team to update.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-member\-definitions\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of \fBMemberDefinition\fP objects that contains objects that identify the workers that make up the work team.
.sp
Workforces can be created using Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon Cognito use \fBCognitoMemberDefinition\fP . For workforces created using your own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use \fBOidcMemberDefinition\fP . You should not provide input for both of these parameters in a single request.
.sp
For workforces created using Amazon Cognito, private work teams correspond to Amazon Cognito \fIuser groups\fP within the user pool used to create a workforce. All of the \fBCognitoMemberDefinition\fP objects that make up the member definition must have the same \fBClientId\fP and \fBUserPool\fP values. To add a Amazon Cognito user group to an existing worker pool, see \fI\%Adding groups to a User Pool . For more information about user pools, see \(gaAmazon Cognito User Pools\fP .
.sp
For workforces created using your own OIDC IdP, specify the user groups that you want to include in your private work team in \fBOidcMemberDefinition\fP by listing those groups in \fBGroups\fP . Be aware that user groups that are already in the work team must also be listed in \fBGroups\fP when you make this request to remain on the work team. If you do not include these user groups, they will no longer be associated with the work team you update.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

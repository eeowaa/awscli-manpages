.SH NAME
cloudwatch-put-composite-alarm \- Creates or updates a composite alarm 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates or updates a \fIcomposite alarm\fP . When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.
.sp
The alarms specified in a composite alarm\(aqs rule expression can include metric alarms and other composite alarms.
.sp
Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.
.sp
Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms are notifying SNS topics.

It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can\(aqt delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.
.sp
To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the \fBAlarmRule\fP of one of the alarms to \fBFalse\fP .
.sp
Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.

.sp
When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to \fBINSUFFICIENT_DATA\fP . The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be in \fBINSUFFICIENT_DATA\fP state.
.sp
When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.
.sp
If you are an IAM user, you must have \fBiam:CreateServiceLinkedRole\fP to create a composite alarm that has Systems Manager OpsItem actions.

.sp
\fB\-\-alarm\-rule\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to determine this composite alarm\(aqs state. For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the functions in your expression.
.sp
You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be evaluated.
.sp
Functions can include the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBALARM("*alarm\-name* or *alarm\-ARN* ")\fP is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOK("*alarm\-name* or *alarm\-ARN* ")\fP is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINSUFFICIENT_DATA("*alarm\-name* or *alarm\-ARN* ")\fP is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBTRUE\fP always evaluates to TRUE.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFALSE\fP always evaluates to FALSE.
.UNINDENT
.sp
TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex \fBAlarmRule\fP structure, and for testing your alarm actions.
.sp
Alarm names specified in \fBAlarmRule\fP can be surrounded with double\-quotes ("), but do not have to be.
.sp
The following are some examples of \fBAlarmRule\fP :
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)\fP specifies that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if both CPUUtilizationTooHigh and DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in ALARM state.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND NOT ALARM(DeploymentInProgress)\fP specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh is in ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is not in ALARM state. This example reduces alarm noise during a known deployment window.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB(ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) OR ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)) AND OK(NetworkOutTooHigh)\fP goes into ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and if NetworkOutTooHigh is in OK state. This provides another example of using a composite alarm to prevent noise. This rule ensures that you are not notified with an alarm action on high CPU or disk usage if a known network problem is also occurring.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBAlarmRule\fP can specify as many as 100 "children" alarms. The \fBAlarmRule\fP expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
Retrieves a list of source locations.

\fBlist\-source\-locations\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBItems\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
Items \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An array of source locations.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This response includes only the "type" : "object" property.
.sp
AccessConfiguration \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The access configuration for the source location.
.sp
AccessType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of authentication used to access content from HttpConfiguration::BaseUrl on your source location. Accepted value: S3_SIGV4.
.sp
S3_SIGV4 \- AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for Amazon S3 hosted virtual\-style access. If your source location base URL is an Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor can use AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4) authentication to access the bucket where your source content is stored. Your MediaTailor source location baseURL must follow the S3 virtual hosted\-style request URL format. For example, \fI\%https://bucket\-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key\-name\fP\&.
.sp
Before you can use S3_SIGV4, you must meet these requirements:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You must allow MediaTailor to access your S3 bucket by granting mediatailor.amazonaws.com principal access in IAM. For information about configuring access in IAM, see Access management in the IAM User Guide.
.IP \(bu 2
The mediatailor.amazonaws.com service principal must have permissions to read all top level manifests referenced by the VodSource packaging configurations.
.IP \(bu 2
The caller of the API must have s3:GetObject IAM permissions to read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor VodSource packaging configurations.

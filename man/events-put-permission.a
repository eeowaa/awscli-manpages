.SH NAME
events-put-permission \- Running PutPermission permits the specified AWS account or AWS organization to put events to the specified event bus 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Running \fBPutPermission\fP permits the specified AWS account or AWS organization to put events to the specified \fIevent bus\fP . Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to an event bus in your account.
.sp
For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have an EventBridge rule with your account\(aqs event bus as a target.
.sp
To enable multiple AWS accounts to put events to your event bus, run \fBPutPermission\fP once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts are members of the same AWS organization, you can run \fBPutPermission\fP once specifying \fBPrincipal\fP as "*" and specifying the AWS organization ID in \fBCondition\fP , to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization.
.sp
If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a \fBRoleArn\fP with proper permissions when they use \fBPutTarget\fP to add your account\(aqs event bus as a target. For more information, see \fI\%Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts\fP in the \fIAmazon EventBridge User Guide\fP .
.sp
The permission policy on the default event bus cannot exceed 10 KB in size.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-event\-bus\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the event bus associated with the rule. If you omit this, the default event bus is used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-action\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The action that you are enabling the other account to perform. Currently, this must be \fBevents:PutEvents\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-principal\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The 12\-digit AWS account ID that you are permitting to put events to your default event bus. Specify "*" to permit any account to put events to your default event bus.
.sp
If you specify "*" without specifying \fBCondition\fP , avoid creating rules that may match undesirable events. To create more secure rules, make sure that the event pattern for each rule contains an \fBaccount\fP field with a specific account ID from which to receive events. Rules with an account field do not match any events sent from other accounts.

.sp
\fB\-\-statement\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An identifier string for the external account that you are granting permissions to. If you later want to revoke the permission for this external account, specify this \fBStatementId\fP when you run  RemovePermission .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-condition\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This parameter enables you to limit the permission to accounts that fulfill a certain condition, such as being a member of a certain AWS organization. For more information about AWS Organizations, see \fI\%What Is AWS Organizations\fP in the \fIAWS Organizations User Guide\fP .
.sp
If you specify \fBCondition\fP with an AWS organization ID, and specify "*" as the value for \fBPrincipal\fP , you grant permission to all the accounts in the named organization.
.sp
The \fBCondition\fP is a JSON string which must contain \fBType\fP , \fBKey\fP , and \fBValue\fP fields.
.sp
Type \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the type of condition. Currently the only supported value is \fBStringEquals\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Key \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the key for the condition. Currently the only supported key is \fBaws:PrincipalOrgID\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Value \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the value for the key. Currently, this must be the ID of the organization.

\fB\-\-policy\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A JSON string that describes the permission policy statement. You can include a \fBPolicy\fP parameter in the request instead of using the \fBStatementId\fP , \fBAction\fP , \fBPrincipal\fP , or \fBCondition\fP parameters.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

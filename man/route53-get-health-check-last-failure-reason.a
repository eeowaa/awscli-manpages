.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-health\-check\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID for the health check for which you want the last failure reason. When you created the health check, \fBCreateHealthCheck\fP returned the ID in the response, in the \fBHealthCheckId\fP element.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you want to get the last failure reason for a calculated health check, you must use the Amazon Route 53 console or the CloudWatch console. You can\(aqt use \fBGetHealthCheckLastFailureReason\fP for a calculated health check.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

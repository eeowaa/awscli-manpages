.sp
\fB\-\-text\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The document text to be analyzed.

\fB\-\-endpoint\-arn\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Classes \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The classes used by the document being analyzed. These are used for multi\-class trained models. Individual classes are mutually exclusive and each document is expected to have only a single class assigned to it. For example, an animal can be a dog or a cat, but not both at the same time.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the class that categorizes the document being analyzed
.sp
Name \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the class.

.sp
Score \-> (float)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The confidence score that Amazon Comprehend has this class correctly attributed.

Labels \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The labels used the document being analyzed. These are used for multi\-label trained models. Individual labels represent different categories that are related in some manner and are not mutually exclusive. For example, a movie can be just an action movie, or it can be an action movie, a science fiction movie, and a comedy, all at the same time.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies one of the label or labels that categorize the document being analyzed.

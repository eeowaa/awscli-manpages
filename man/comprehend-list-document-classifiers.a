\fBlist\-document\-classifiers\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBDocumentClassifierPropertiesList\fP

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

\fBCOMPREHEND_CSV\fP : A two\-column CSV file, where labels are provided in the first column, and documents are provided in the second. If you use this value, you must provide the \fBS3Uri\fP parameter in your request.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAUGMENTED_MANIFEST\fP : A labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines format. Each line is a complete JSON object that contains a training document and its associated labels.  If you use this value, you must provide the \fBAugmentedManifests\fP parameter in your request.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses \fBCOMPREHEND_CSV\fP as the default.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
S3Uri \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket must be in the same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of input files.
.sp
For example, if you use the URI \fBS3://bucketName/prefix\fP , if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

Indicates the delimiter used to separate each label for training a multi\-label classifier. The default delimiter between labels is a pipe (|). You can use a different character as a delimiter (if it\(aqs an allowed character) by specifying it under Delimiter for labels. If the training documents use a delimiter other than the default or the delimiter you specify, the labels on that line will be combined to make a single unique label, such as LABELLABELLABEL.

The URI must be in the same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The location is used as the prefix for the actual location of this output file.
.sp
When the custom classifier job is finished, the service creates the output file in a directory specific to the job. The \fBS3Uri\fP field contains the location of the output file, called \fBoutput.tar.gz\fP . It is a compressed archive that contains the confusion matrix.

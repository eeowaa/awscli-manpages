.SH NAME
s3api-put-bucket-website \- Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the website subresource
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the \fBwebsite\fP subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this subresource on the bucket with website configuration information such as the file name of the index document and any redirect rules. For more information, see \fI\%Hosting Websites on Amazon S3\fP .
.sp
This PUT action requires the \fBS3:PutBucketWebsite\fP permission. By default, only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them the \fBS3:PutBucketWebsite\fP permission.
.sp
To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket\(aqs website endpoint, you add a website configuration with the following elements. Because all requests are sent to another website, you don\(aqt need to provide index document name for the bucket.

.sp
If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the following elements to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting requests and information about the redirect destination. In this case, the website configuration must provide an index document for the bucket, because some requests might not be redirected.

Amazon S3 has a limitation of 50 routing rules per website configuration. If you require more than 50 routing rules, you can use object redirect. For more information, see \fI\%Configuring an Object Redirect\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

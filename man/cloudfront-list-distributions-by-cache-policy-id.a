.SH NAME
cloudfront-list-distributions-by-cache-policy-id \- Gets a list of distribution IDs for distributions that have a cache behavior that’s associated with the specified cache policy
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gets a list of distribution IDs for distributions that have a cache behavior that’s associated with the specified cache policy.
.sp
You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the \fBNextMarker\fP value from the current response as the \fBMarker\fP value in the subsequent request.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-marker\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of distribution IDs. The response includes distribution IDs in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of the list, set this field’s value to the value of \fBNextMarker\fP from the current page’s response.

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of distribution IDs that you want in the response.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cache\-policy\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the cache policy whose associated distribution IDs you want to list.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

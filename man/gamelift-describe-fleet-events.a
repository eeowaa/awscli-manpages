.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves entries from a fleet\(aqs event log. Fleet events are initiated by changes in status, such as during fleet creation and termination, changes in capacity, etc. If a fleet has multiple locations, events are also initiated by changes to status and capacity in remote locations.
.sp
You can specify a time range to limit the result set. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
.sp
If successful, a collection of event log entries matching the request are returned.

\fBdescribe\-fleet\-events\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBEvents\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-fleet\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the fleet to get event logs for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-start\-time\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The earliest date to retrieve event logs for. If no start time is specified, this call returns entries starting from when the fleet was created to the specified end time. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (ex: "1469498468.057").
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-end\-time\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The most recent date to retrieve event logs for. If no end time is specified, this call returns entries from the specified start time up to the present. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (ex: "1469498468.057").
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING \-\- Fleet status changed from \fBNEW\fP to \fBDOWNLOADING\fP . The compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation.
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED \-\- The build failed to download to the fleet instance.
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to \fBACTIVE\fP status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in \fIPreSignedLogUrl\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully extracted, and the GameLift is now running the build\(aqs install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to \fBACTIVE\fP status. Logs for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in \fIPreSignedLogUrl\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG \-\- The build process was successful, and the GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet\(aqs runtime configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to \fBACTIVE\fP status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by using the URL in \fIPreSignedLogUrl\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING \-\- Fleet status changed from \fBDOWNLOADING\fP to \fBVALIDATING\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND \-\- Validation of the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance.
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_STATE_BUILDING \-\- Fleet status changed from \fBVALIDATING\fP to \fBBUILDING\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE \-\- Validation of the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING \-\- Fleet status changed from \fBBUILDING\fP to \fBACTIVATING\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED \- The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server process. Learn more at \fI\%Debug Fleet Creation Issues\fP
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED \-\- A requested VPC peering connection has failed. Event details and status information (see  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections ) provide additional detail. A common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your AWS account.

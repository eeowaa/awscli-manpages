.SH NAME
elastictranscoder-create-job \- When
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
When you create a job, Elastic Transcoder returns JSON data that includes the values that you specified plus information about the job that is created.
.sp
If you have specified more than one output for your jobs (for example, one output for the Kindle Fire and another output for the Apple iPhone 4s), you currently must use the Elastic Transcoder API to list the jobs (as opposed to the AWS Console).
.sp
See also: AWS API Documentation

InputCaptions \-> (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All captions must be in UTF\-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two types of captions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEmbedded:\fP Embedded captions are included in the same file as the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded captions per file. Valid input values include: \fBCEA\-608 (EIA\-608\fP , first non\-empty channel only), \fBCEA\-708 (EIA\-708\fP , first non\-empty channel only), and \fBmov\-text\fP   Valid outputs include: \fBmov\-text\fP   Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one embedded format per output.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSidecar:\fP Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file from the audio and video data. Sidecar captions require a player that is capable of understanding the relationship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid input values include: \fBdfxp\fP (first div element only), \fBebu\-tt\fP , \fBscc\fP , \fBsmpt\fP , \fBsrt\fP , \fBttml\fP (first div element only), and \fBwebvtt\fP   Valid outputs include: \fBdfxp\fP (first div element only), \fBscc\fP , \fBsrt\fP , and \fBwebvtt\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want ttml or smpte\-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format.
.sp
Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for captions, and is not available for audio\-only transcoding. Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during the transcoding process.
.sp
To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set \fBCaptions\fP to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the \fBMergePolicy\fP to \fBMergeRetain\fP , and pass in a null \fBCaptionSources\fP array.
.sp
For more information on embedded files, see the Subtitles Wikipedia page.
.sp
For more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.
.sp
MergePolicy \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A policy that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles the existence of multiple captions.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMergeOverride:\fP Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the embedded captions for that language.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMergeRetain:\fP Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the embedded captions and ignores the sidecar captions for that language. If \fBCaptionSources\fP is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all sidecar captions from the output files.

Information about the watermarks that you want Elastic Transcoder to add to the video during transcoding. You can specify up to four watermarks for each output. Settings for each watermark must be defined in the preset that you specify in \fBPreset\fP for the current output.
.sp
Watermarks are added to the output video in the sequence in which you list them in the job output—the first watermark in the list is added to the output video first, the second watermark in the list is added next, and so on. As a result, if the settings in a preset cause Elastic Transcoder to place all watermarks in the same location, the second watermark that you add covers the first one, the third one covers the second, and the fourth one covers the third.

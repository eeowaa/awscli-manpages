.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-policy\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the policy that you want to delete. You can retrieve this ID from \fBPutPolicy\fP and \fBListPolicies\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-delete\-all\-policy\-resources\fP | \fB\-\-no\-delete\-all\-policy\-resources\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If \fBTrue\fP , the request performs cleanup according to the policy type.
.sp
For AWS WAF and Shield Advanced policies, the cleanup does the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Deletes rule groups created by AWS Firewall Manager
.IP \(bu 2
Removes web ACLs from in\-scope resources
.IP \(bu 2
Deletes web ACLs that contain no rules or rule groups
.UNINDENT
.sp
For security group policies, the cleanup does the following for each security group in the policy:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Disassociates the security group from in\-scope resources
.IP \(bu 2
Deletes the security group if it was created through Firewall Manager and if it\(aqs no longer associated with any resources through another policy
.UNINDENT
.sp
After the cleanup, in\-scope resources are no longer protected by web ACLs in this policy. Protection of out\-of\-scope resources remains unchanged. Scope is determined by tags that you create and accounts that you associate with the policy. When creating the policy, if you specify that only resources in specific accounts or with specific tags are in scope of the policy, those accounts and resources are handled by the policy. All others are out of scope. If you don\(aqt specify tags or accounts, all resources are in scope.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

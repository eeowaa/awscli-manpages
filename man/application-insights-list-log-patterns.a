.sp
\fB\-\-resource\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the resource group.

\fB\-\-pattern\-set\-name\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The name of the log pattern set.

\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned \fBNextToken\fP value.

\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)

The token to request the next page of results.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
ResourceGroupName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the resource group.
.UNINDENT

.sp
LogPatterns \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of log patterns.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An object that defines the log patterns that belongs to a \fBLogPatternSet\fP .
.sp
PatternSetName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the log pattern. A log pattern name can contain as many as 30 characters, and it cannot be empty. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following symbols: period, dash, underscore.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PatternName \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the log pattern. A log pattern name can contain as many as 50 characters, and it cannot be empty. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following symbols: period, dash, underscore.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pattern \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A regular expression that defines the log pattern. A log pattern can contain as many as 50 characters, and it cannot be empty. The pattern must be DFA compatible. Patterns that utilize forward lookahead or backreference constructions are not supported.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Rank \-> (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Rank of the log pattern. Must be a value between \fB1\fP and \fB1,000,000\fP . The patterns are sorted by rank, so we recommend that you set your highest priority patterns with the lowest rank. A pattern of rank \fB1\fP will be the first to get matched to a log line. A pattern of rank \fB1,000,000\fP will be last to get matched. When you configure custom log patterns from the console, a \fBLow\fP severity pattern translates to a \fB750,000\fP rank. A \fBMedium\fP severity pattern translates to a \fB500,000\fP rank. And a \fBHigh\fP severity pattern translates to a \fB250,000\fP rank. Rank values less than \fB1\fP or greater than \fB1,000,000\fP are reserved for AWS\-provided patterns.

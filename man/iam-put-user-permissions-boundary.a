.SH NAME
iam-put-user-permissions-boundary \- Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM user(aqs permissions boundary
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM user\(aqs permissions boundary. You can use an AWS managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for a user. Use the boundary to control the maximum permissions that the user can have. Setting a permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the permissions for the user.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Policies that are used as permissions boundaries do not provide permissions. You must also attach a permissions policy to the user. To learn how the effective permissions for a user are evaluated, see \fI\%IAM JSON policy evaluation logic\fP in the IAM User Guide.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
gamelift-delete-script \- Deletes a Realtime script
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a Realtime script. This operation permanently deletes the script record. If script files were uploaded, they are also deleted (files stored in an S3 bucket are not deleted).
.sp
To delete a script, specify the script ID. Before deleting a script, be sure to terminate all fleets that are deployed with the script being deleted. Fleet instances periodically check for script updates, and if the script record no longer exists, the instance will go into an error state and be unable to host game sessions.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

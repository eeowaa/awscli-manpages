.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Provides sending statistics for the current AWS Region. The result is a list of data points, representing the last two weeks of sending activity. Each data point in the list contains statistics for a 15\-minute period of time.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

The result is a list of data points, representing the last two weeks of sending activity. Each data point in the list
contains statistics for a 15\-minute interval.
.sp
In this example, there are only two data points because the only emails that the user sent in the last two weeks fell
within two 15\-minute intervals.
.sp

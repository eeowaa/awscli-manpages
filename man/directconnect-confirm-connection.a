.SH NAME
directconnect-confirm-connection \- Confirms the creation of the specified hosted connection on an interconnect
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Confirms the creation of the specified hosted connection on an interconnect.
.sp
Upon creation, the hosted connection is initially in the \fBOrdering\fP state, and remains in this state until the owner confirms creation of the hosted connection.
.sp

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

connectionState \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The state of the connection. The following are the possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBordering\fP : The initial state of a hosted connection provisioned on an interconnect. The connection stays in the ordering state until the owner of the hosted connection confirms or declines the connection order.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrequested\fP : The initial state of a standard connection. The connection stays in the requested state until the Letter of Authorization (LOA) is sent to the customer.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpending\fP : The connection has been approved and is being initialized.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBavailable\fP : The network link is up and the connection is ready for use.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdown\fP : The network link is down.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdeleting\fP : The connection is being deleted.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdeleted\fP : The connection has been deleted.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrejected\fP : A hosted connection in the \fBordering\fP state enters the \fBrejected\fP state if it is deleted by the customer.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBunknown\fP : The state of the connection is not available.

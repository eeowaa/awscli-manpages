storagegateway-delete-bandwidth-rate-limit \- Deletes the bandwidth rate limits of a gateway
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the bandwidth rate limits of a gateway. You can delete either the upload and download bandwidth rate limit, or you can delete both. If you delete only one of the limits, the other limit remains unchanged. To specify which gateway to work with, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request. This operation is supported for the stored volume, cached volume and tape gateway types.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

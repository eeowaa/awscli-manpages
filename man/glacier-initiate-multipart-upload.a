.SH NAME
glacier-initiate-multipart-upload \- This operation initiates a multipart upload
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon S3 Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see  UploadMultipartPart ).
.sp
When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2\-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.
.sp
Every part you upload to this resource (see  UploadMultipartPart ), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.

\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You don\(aqt need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours.
.sp
An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\(aqt have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see \fI\%Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\fP .
.sp
For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see \fI\%Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload)\fP and \fI\%Initiate Multipart Upload\fP in the \fIAmazon Glacier Developer Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-account\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBAccountId\fP value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single \(aq\fB\-\fP \(aq (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens (\(aq\-\(aq) in the ID.

\fB\-\-archive\-description\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The archive description that you are uploading in parts.

The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2, for example 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB (4096 MB).

\fB\-\-part\-size\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The size of each part except the last, in bytes. The last part can be smaller than this part size.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
The following command initiates a multipart upload to a vault named \fBmy\-vault\fP with a part size of 1 MiB (1024 x 1024 bytes) per file:

.sp
The archive description parameter is optional. Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when performing operations, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in\-use account.
.sp
This command outputs an upload ID when successful. Use the upload ID when uploading each part of your archive with \fBaws glacier upload\-multipart\-part\fP\&. For more information on multipart uploads to Amazon Glacier using the AWS CLI, see \fI\%Using Amazon Glacier\fP in the \fIAWS CLI User Guide\fP\&.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Invites other AWS accounts to become member accounts for the Security Hub administrator account that the invitation is sent from.
.sp
This operation is only used to invite accounts that do not belong to an organization. Organization accounts do not receive invitations.
.sp
Before you can use this action to invite a member, you must first use the \(ga\(ga  CreateMembers \(ga\(ga action to create the member account in Security Hub.
.sp
When the account owner enables Security Hub and accepts the invitation to become a member account, the administrator account can view the findings generated from the member account.
.sp
See also: AWS API Documentation
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
If you enable webhooks for an AWS CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step in AWS CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through AWS CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per\-build basis, you are billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using AWS CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in AWS CodeBuild. In the AWS CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more information, see step 5 in \fI\%Change a Build Project\(aqs Settings\fP .

pattern \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For a \fBWebHookFilter\fP that uses \fBEVENT\fP type, a comma\-separated string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook filter \fBPUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED\fP allows all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to trigger a build.
.sp
For a \fBWebHookFilter\fP that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a \fBWebHookFilter\fP that uses \fBHEAD_REF\fP for its \fBtype\fP and the pattern \fB^refs/heads/\fP triggers a build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name \fBrefs/heads/branch\-name\fP .
.UNINDENT

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo create webhook filters for an AWS CodeBuild project\fP
.sp
The following \fBcreate\-webhook\fP example creates a webhook for a CodeBuild project named \fBmy\-project\fP that has two filter groups. The first filter group specifies pull requests that are created, updated, or reopened on branches with Git reference names that match the regular expression \fB^refs/heads/master$\fP and head references that match \fB^refs/heads/myBranch$\fP\&.  The second filter group specifies push requests on branches with Git reference names that do not match the regular expression \fB^refs/heads/myBranch$\fP\&.

.SH NAME
sagemaker-stop-training-job \- Stops a training job
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Stops a training job. To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the \fBSIGTERM\fP signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms might use this 120\-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of the training is not lost.
.sp
When it receives a \fBStopTrainingJob\fP request, Amazon SageMaker changes the status of the job to \fBStopping\fP . After Amazon SageMaker stops the job, it sets the status to \fBStopped\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

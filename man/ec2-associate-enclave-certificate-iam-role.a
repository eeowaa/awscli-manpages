.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Associates an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate. This enables the certificate to be used by the ACM for Nitro Enclaves application inside an enclave. For more information, see \fI\%AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves\fP in the \fIAWS Nitro Enclaves User Guide\fP .
.sp
When the IAM role is associated with the ACM certificate, the certificate, certificate chain, and encrypted private key are placed in an Amazon S3 bucket that only the associated IAM role can access. The private key of the certificate is encrypted with an AWS\-managed KMS customer master (CMK) that has an attached attestation\-based CMK policy.
.sp
To enable the IAM role to access the Amazon S3 object, you must grant it permission to call \fBs3:GetObject\fP on the Amazon S3 bucket returned by the command. To enable the IAM role to access the AWS KMS CMK, you must grant it permission to call \fBkms:Decrypt\fP on the AWS KMS CMK returned by the command. For more information, see \fI\%Grant the role permission to access the certificate and encryption key\fP in the \fIAWS Nitro Enclaves User Guide\fP .

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-certificate\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the ACM certificate with which to associate the IAM role.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-role\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the IAM role to associate with the ACM certificate. You can associate up to 16 IAM roles with an ACM certificate.

.sp
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fP | \fB\-\-no\-dry\-run\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \fBDryRunOperation\fP . Otherwise, it is \fBUnauthorizedOperation\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

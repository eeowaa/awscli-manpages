.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Adds remote locations to a fleet and begins populating the new locations with EC2 instances. The new instances conform to the fleet\(aqs instance type, auto\-scaling, and other configuration settings.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This operation cannot be used with fleets that don\(aqt support remote locations. Fleets can have multiple locations only if they reside in AWS Regions that support this feature (see  CreateFleet for the complete list) and were created after the feature was released in March 2021.

.sp
To add fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and provide a list of one or more locations.
.sp
If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations with their status set to \fBNEW\fP . GameLift initiates the process of starting an instance in each added location. You can track the status of each new location by monitoring location creation events using  DescribeFleetEvents . Alternatively, you can poll location status by calling  DescribeFleetLocationAttributes . After a location status becomes \fBACTIVE\fP , you can adjust the location\(aqs capacity as needed with  UpdateFleetCapacity .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

FleetArn \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (\fI\%ARN\fP ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is \fBarn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet\-a1234567\-b8c9\-0d1e\-2fa3\-b45c6d7e8912\fP .

LocationStates \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The remote locations that are being added to the fleet, and the life\-cycle status of each location. For new locations, the status is set to \fBNEW\fP . During location creation, GameLift updates each location\(aqs status as instances are deployed there and prepared for game hosting. This list does not include the fleet home Region or any remote locations that were already added to the fleet.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A fleet location and its life\-cycle state. A location state object might be used to describe a fleet\(aqs remote location or home Region. Life\-cycle state tracks the progress of launching the first instance in a new location and preparing it for game hosting, and then removing all instances and deleting the location from the fleet.

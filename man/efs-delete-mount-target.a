.SH NAME
efs-delete-mount-target \- Deletes the specified mount target
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified mount target.
.sp
This operation forcibly breaks any mounts of the file system by using the mount target that is being deleted, which might disrupt instances or applications using those mounts. To avoid applications getting cut off abruptly, you might consider unmounting any mounts of the mount target, if feasible. The operation also deletes the associated network interface. Uncommitted writes might be lost, but breaking a mount target using this operation does not corrupt the file system itself. The file system you created remains. You can mount an EC2 instance in your VPC by using another mount target.
.sp
This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file system:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBelasticfilesystem:DeleteMountTarget\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBDeleteMountTarget\fP call returns while the mount target state is still \fBdeleting\fP . You can check the mount target deletion by calling the  DescribeMountTargets operation, which returns a list of mount target descriptions for the given file system.

.sp
The operation also requires permissions for the following Amazon EC2 action on the mount target\(aqs network interface:

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

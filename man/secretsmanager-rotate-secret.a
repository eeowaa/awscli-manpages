.SH NAME
secretsmanager-rotate-secret \- Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating this secret
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating this secret. If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets those values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you do not include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret. After the rotation completes, the protected service and its clients all use the new version of the secret.
.sp
This required configuration information includes the ARN of an AWS Lambda function and the time between scheduled rotations. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on the protected service to match. After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret with the staging label \fBAWSCURRENT\fP so that your clients all immediately begin to use the new version. For more information about rotating secrets and how to configure a Lambda function to rotate the secrets for your protected service, see \fI\%Rotating Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager\fP in the \fIAWS Secrets Manager User Guide\fP .
.sp
Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one completes. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24\-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.
.sp
The rotation function must end with the versions of the secret in one of two states:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBAWSPENDING\fP and \fBAWSCURRENT\fP staging labels are attached to the same version of the secret, or
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBAWSPENDING\fP staging label is not attached to any version of the secret.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the \fBAWSPENDING\fP staging label is present but not attached to the same version as \fBAWSCURRENT\fP then any later invocation of \fBRotateSecret\fP assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-secret\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the secret that you want to rotate. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
.sp
If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the \(aqfriendly name\(aq, you \fImust\fP not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a \fIResourceNotFoundException\fP or an \fIAccessDeniedException\fP error, depending on your permissions.

.sp
\fB\-\-client\-request\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Specifies a unique identifier for the new version of the secret that helps ensure idempotency.
.sp
If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request for this parameter. If you don\(aqt use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a \fBClientRequestToken\fP yourself for new versions and include that value in the request.
.sp
You only need to specify your own value if you implement your own retry logic and want to ensure that a given secret is not created twice. We recommend that you generate a \fI\%UUID\-type\fP value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.
.sp
Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the function\(aqs processing. This value becomes the \fBVersionId\fP of the new version.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-rotation\-lambda\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
\fB\-\-rotation\-rules\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A structure that defines the rotation configuration for this secret.
.sp
AutomaticallyAfterDays \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the secret.
.sp
Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24\-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES

\fBTo configure rotation for a secret\fP
.sp
The following example configures rotation for a secret by providing the ARN of a Lambda rotation function (which must already exist) and the number of days between rotation.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a delivery stream and its data.
.sp
To check the state of a delivery stream, use  DescribeDeliveryStream . You can delete a delivery stream only if it is in one of the following states: \fBACTIVE\fP , \fBDELETING\fP , \fBCREATING_FAILED\fP , or \fBDELETING_FAILED\fP . You can\(aqt delete a delivery stream that is in the \fBCREATING\fP state. While the deletion request is in process, the delivery stream is in the \fBDELETING\fP state.
.sp
While the delivery stream is in the \fBDELETING\fP state, the service might continue to accept records, but it doesn\(aqt make any guarantees with respect to delivering the data. Therefore, as a best practice, first stop any applications that are sending records before you delete a delivery stream.

The name of the delivery stream.

.INDENT 3.5
Set this to true if you want to delete the delivery stream even if Kinesis Data Firehose is unable to retire the grant for the CMK. Kinesis Data Firehose might be unable to retire the grant due to a customer error, such as when the CMK or the grant are in an invalid state. If you force deletion, you can then use the \fI\%RevokeGrant\fP operation to revoke the grant you gave to Kinesis Data Firehose. If a failure to retire the grant happens due to an AWS KMS issue, Kinesis Data Firehose keeps retrying the delete operation.
.sp
The default value is false.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

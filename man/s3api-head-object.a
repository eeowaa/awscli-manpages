.SH NAME
s3api-head-object \- The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This action is useful if you\(aqre only interested in an object\(aqs metadata. To use HEAD, you must have READ access to the object.
.sp
A \fBHEAD\fP request has the same options as a \fBGET\fP action on an object. The response is identical to the \fBGET\fP response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the \fBHEAD\fP request generates an error, it returns a generic \fB404 Not Found\fP or \fB403 Forbidden\fP code. It is not possible to retrieve the exact exception beyond these error codes.
.sp
If you encrypt an object by using server\-side encryption with customer\-provided encryption keys (SSE\-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
x\-amz\-server\-side\-encryption\-customer\-algorithm
.IP \(bu 2
x\-amz\-server\-side\-encryption\-customer\-key
.IP \(bu 2
x\-amz\-server\-side\-encryption\-customer\-key\-MD5
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more information about SSE\-C, see \fI\%Server\-Side Encryption (Using Customer\-Provided Encryption Keys)\fP .
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Encryption request headers, like \fBx\-amz\-server\-side\-encryption\fP , should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server\-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE\-KMS) or server\-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE\-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.
.IP \(bu 2
The last modified property in this case is the creation date of the object.

Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see \fI\%Common Request Headers\fP .
.sp
Consider the following when using request headers:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Consideration 1 – If both of the \fBIf\-Match\fP and \fBIf\-Unmodified\-Since\fP headers are present in the request as follows:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIf\-Match\fP condition evaluates to \fBtrue\fP , and;
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIf\-Unmodified\-Since\fP condition evaluates to \fBfalse\fP ;
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then Amazon S3 returns \fB200 OK\fP and the data requested.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Consideration 2 – If both of the \fBIf\-None\-Match\fP and \fBIf\-Modified\-Since\fP headers are present in the request as follows:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIf\-None\-Match\fP condition evaluates to \fBfalse\fP , and;
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIf\-Modified\-Since\fP condition evaluates to \fBtrue\fP ;
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then Amazon S3 returns the \fB304 Not Modified\fP response code.
.sp
For more information about conditional requests, see \fI\%RFC 7232\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBPermissions\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You need the \fBs3:GetObject\fP permission for this operation. For more information, see \fI\%Specifying Permissions in a Policy\fP . If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you have the \fBs3:ListBucket\fP permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.
.IP \(bu 2
If you don’t have the \fBs3:ListBucket\fP permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .s3\-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \fI\%Using access points\fP in the \fIAmazon S3 User Guide\fP .
.sp
When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form \fIAccessPointName\fP \-\fIAccountId\fP .*outpostID* .s3\-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name.

.sp
ReplicationStatus \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or a destination in a replication rule.
.sp
In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and destination bucket or buckets where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object (\fBGetObject\fP ) or object metadata (\fBHeadObject\fP ) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the \fBx\-amz\-replication\-status\fP header in the response as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If requesting an object from the source bucket — Amazon S3 will return the \fBx\-amz\-replication\-status\fP header if the object in your request is eligible for replication. For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify object prefix \fBTaxDocs\fP requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix \fBTaxDocs\fP . Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example \fBTaxDocs/document1.pdf\fP , are eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the \fBx\-amz\-replication\-status\fP header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object replication status.
.IP \(bu 2
If requesting an object from a destination bucket — Amazon S3 will return the \fBx\-amz\-replication\-status\fP header with value REPLICA if the object in your request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and there is no replica modification replication in progress.
.IP \(bu 2
When replicating objects to multiple destination buckets the \fBx\-amz\-replication\-status\fP header acts differently. The header of the source object will only return a value of COMPLETED when replication is successful to all destinations. The header will remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all destinations. If one or more destinations fails replication the header will return FAILED.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ObjectLockRetainUntilDate \-> (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies whether a legal hold is in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the requester has the \fBs3:GetObjectLegalHold\fP permission. This header is not returned if the specified version of this object has never had a legal hold applied. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see \fI\%Object Lock\fP .

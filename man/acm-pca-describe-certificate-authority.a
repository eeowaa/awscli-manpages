.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists information about your private certificate authority (CA) or one that has been shared with you. You specify the private CA on input by its ARN (Amazon Resource Name). The output contains the status of your CA. This can be any of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCREATING\fP \- ACM Private CA is creating your private certificate authority.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPENDING_CERTIFICATE\fP \- The certificate is pending. You must use your ACM Private CA\-hosted or on\-premises root or subordinate CA to sign your private CA CSR and then import it into PCA.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACTIVE\fP \- Your private CA is active.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDISABLED\fP \- Your private CA has been disabled.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEXPIRED\fP \- Your private CA certificate has expired.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFAILED\fP \- Your private CA has failed. Your CA can fail because of problems such a network outage or back\-end AWS failure or other errors. A failed CA can never return to the pending state. You must create a new CA.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETED\fP \- Your private CA is within the restoration period, after which it is permanently deleted. The length of time remaining in the CA\(aqs restoration period is also included in this action\(aqs output.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Default: FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_3_OR_HIGHER
.sp
Note: AWS Region ap\-northeast\-3 supports only FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_2_OR_HIGHER. You must explicitly specify this parameter and value when creating a CA in that Region. Specifying a different value (or no value) results in an \fBInvalidArgsException\fP with the message "A certificate authority cannot be created in this region with the specified security standard."

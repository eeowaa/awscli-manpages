.SH NAME
route53resolver-list-firewall-rule-group-associations \- Retrieves the firewall rule group associations that you have defined
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves the firewall rule group associations that you have defined. Each association enables DNS filtering for a VPC with one rule group.
.sp
A single call might return only a partial list of the associations. For information, see \fBMaxResults\fP .

\fBlist\-firewall\-rule\-group\-associations\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBFirewallRuleGroupAssociations\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-firewall\-rule\-group\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier of the firewall rule group that you want to retrieve the associations for. Leave this blank to retrieve associations for any rule group.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-vpc\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier of the VPC that you want to retrieve the associations for. Leave this blank to retrieve associations for any VPC.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-priority\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The setting that determines the processing order of the rule group among the rule groups that are associated with a single VPC. DNS Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from rule group with the lowest numeric priority setting.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-status\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The association \fBStatus\fP setting that you want DNS Firewall to filter on for the list. If you don\(aqt specify this, then DNS Firewall returns all associations, regardless of status.
.sp
Possible values:

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

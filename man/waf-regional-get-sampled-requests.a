\fBFor the latest version of AWS WAF\fP , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the \fI\%AWS WAF Developer Guide\fP . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

.sp
Gets detailed information about a specified number of requests\-\-a sample\-\-that AWS WAF randomly selects from among the first 5,000 requests that your AWS resource received during a time range that you choose. You can specify a sample size of up to 500 requests, and you can specify any time range in the previous three hours.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBGetSampledRequests\fP returns a time range, which is usually the time range that you specified. However, if your resource (such as a CloudFront distribution) received 5,000 requests before the specified time range elapsed, \fBGetSampledRequests\fP returns an updated time range. This new time range indicates the actual period during which AWS WAF selected the requests in the sample.

\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of requests that you want AWS WAF to return from among the first 5,000 requests that your AWS resource received during the time range. If your resource received fewer requests than the value of \fBMaxItems\fP , \fBGetSampledRequests\fP returns information about all of them.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

cwsyn\-\fIMyCanaryName\fP \(ga\(ga .
.IP "System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 27)"
Inline literal start\-string without end\-string.
.IP \(bu 2

Inline literal start\-string without end\-string.
.IP \(bu 2
Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the canary\(aqs artifact location.
.IP \(bu 2
IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created in the console, these roles have the name 
.nf
\(ga\(ga

role/service\-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole\-\fIMyCanaryName\fP \(ga\(ga .
.IP "System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 33)"

Before you delete a canary, you might want to use \fBGetCanary\fP to display the information about this canary. Make note of the information returned by this operation so that you can delete these resources after you delete the canary.

\fB\-\-name\fP (string)

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

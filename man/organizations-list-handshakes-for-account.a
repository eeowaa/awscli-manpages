.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists the current handshakes that are associated with the account of the requesting user.
.sp
Handshakes that are \fBACCEPTED\fP , \fBDECLINED\fP , or \fBCANCELED\fP appear in the results of this API for only 30 days after changing to that state. After that, they\(aqre deleted and no longer accessible.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Always check the \fBNextToken\fP response parameter for a \fBnull\fP value when calling a \fBList*\fP operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The \fBNextToken\fP response parameter value is \fBnull\fP  \fIonly\fP when there are no more results to display.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation can be called from any account in the organization.

\fBlist\-handshakes\-for\-account\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBHandshakes\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-filter\fP (structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Filters the handshakes that you want included in the response. The default is all types. Use the \fBActionType\fP element to limit the output to only a specified type, such as \fBINVITE\fP , \fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP , or \fBAPPROVE_ALL_FEATURES\fP . Alternatively, for the \fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP handshake that generates a separate child handshake for each member account, you can specify \fBParentHandshakeId\fP to see only the handshakes that were generated by that parent request.
.sp
ActionType \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the type of handshake action.
.sp
If you specify \fBActionType\fP , you cannot also specify \fBParentHandshakeId\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ParentHandshakeId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the parent handshake. Only used for handshake types that are a child of another type.
.sp
If you specify \fBParentHandshakeId\fP , you cannot also specify \fBActionType\fP .
.sp
The \fI\%regex pattern\fP for handshake ID string requires "h\-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.INDENT 3.5
The current state of the handshake. Use the state to trace the flow of the handshake through the process from its creation to its acceptance. The meaning of each of the valid values is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBREQUESTED\fP : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some handshake types) and not all recipients have responded yet. The request stays in this state until all recipients respond.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOPEN\fP : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some policy types) and all recipients have responded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake action.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCANCELED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because it was canceled by the originating account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACCEPTED\fP : This handshake is complete because it has been accepted by the recipient.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDECLINED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because it was declined by the recipient account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEXPIRED\fP : This handshake is no longer active because the originator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipient before the expiration time (15 days).
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Action \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of handshake, indicating what action occurs when the recipient accepts the handshake. The following handshake types are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINVITE\fP : This type of handshake represents a request to join an organization. It is always sent from the management account to only non\-member accounts.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP : This type of handshake represents a request to enable all features in an organization. It is always sent from the management account to only \fIinvited\fP member accounts. Created accounts do not receive this because those accounts were created by the organization\(aqs management account and approval is inferred.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAPPROVE_ALL_FEATURES\fP : This type of handshake is sent from the Organizations service when all member accounts have approved the \fBENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\fP invitation. It is sent only to the management account and signals the master that it can finalize the process to enable all features.

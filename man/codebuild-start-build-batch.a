Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, \fBlocation\fP should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline ignores it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline\(aqs source action instead of this value.
.IP \(bu 2
For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, \fBhttps://git\-codecommit.<region\-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo\-name>\fP ).

(After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the \fBsource\fP object, set the \fBauth\fP object\(aqs \fBtype\fP value to \fBOAUTH\fP .

The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, \fBarn:aws:s3:::my\-codebuild\-sample2/buildspec.yml\fP ).

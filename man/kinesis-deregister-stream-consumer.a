.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
To deregister a consumer, provide its ARN. Alternatively, you can provide the ARN of the data stream and the name you gave the consumer when you registered it. You may also provide all three parameters, as long as they don\(aqt conflict with each other. If you don\(aqt know the name or ARN of the consumer that you want to deregister, you can use the  ListStreamConsumers operation to get a list of the descriptions of all the consumers that are currently registered with a given data stream. The description of a consumer contains its name and ARN.
.sp
This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per stream.

The ARN of the Kinesis data stream that the consumer is registered with. For more information, see \fI\%Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces\fP .

The name that you gave to the consumer.

\fB\-\-consumer\-arn\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The ARN returned by Kinesis Data Streams when you registered the consumer. If you don\(aqt know the ARN of the consumer that you want to deregister, you can use the ListStreamConsumers operation to get a list of the descriptions of all the consumers that are currently registered with a given data stream. The description of a consumer contains its ARN.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

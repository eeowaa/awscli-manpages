.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token returned from a previous call to \fBListDeliverabilityTestReports\fP to indicate the position in the list of predictive inbox placement tests.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The number of results to show in a single call to \fBListDeliverabilityTestReports\fP . If the number of results is larger than the number you specified in this parameter, then the response includes a \fBNextToken\fP element, which you can use to obtain additional results.
.sp
The value you specify has to be at least 0, and can be no more than 1000.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

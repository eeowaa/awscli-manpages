.SH NAME
logs-get-log-group-fields \- Returns a list of the fields that are included in log events in the specified log group, along with the percentage of log events that contain each field
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns a list of the fields that are included in log events in the specified log group, along with the percentage of log events that contain each field. The search is limited to a time period that you specify.
.sp
In the results, fields that start with @ are fields generated by CloudWatch Logs. For example, \fB@timestamp\fP is the timestamp of each log event. For more information about the fields that are generated by CloudWatch logs, see \fI\%Supported Logs and Discovered Fields\fP .
.sp
The response results are sorted by the frequency percentage, starting with the highest percentage.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-log\-group\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the log group to search.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-time\fP (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The time to set as the center of the query. If you specify \fBtime\fP , the 15 minutes before this time are queries. If you omit \fBtime\fP the 8 minutes before and 8 minutes after this time are searched.
.sp
The \fBtime\fP value is specified as epoch time, the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

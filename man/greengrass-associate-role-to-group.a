.SH NAME
greengrass-associate-role-to-group \- Associates a role with a group

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-group\-id\fP (string)
The ID of the Greengrass group.
.sp
\fB\-\-role\-arn\fP (string)
The ARN of the role you wish to associate with this group. The existence of the role is not validated.
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo associate a role with a Greengrass group\fP
.sp
The following \fBassociate\-role\-to\-group\fP example associates the specified IAM role with a Greengrass group. The group role is used by local Lambda functions and connectors to access AWS services. For example, your group role might grant permissions required for CloudWatch Logs integration.

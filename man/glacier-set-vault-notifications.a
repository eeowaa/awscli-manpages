.SH NAME
glacier-set-vault-notifications \- This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific events happen to a vault
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific events happen to a vault. By default, you don\(aqt get any notifications.
.sp
To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the \fBnotification\-configuration\fP subresource of the vault. The request should include a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific events for which you want Amazon S3 Glacier to send notifications to the topic.
.sp
Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to publish notifications to the topic. You can configure a vault to publish a notification for the following vault events:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBArchiveRetrievalCompleted\fP This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an archive retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from  DescribeJob .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBInventoryRetrievalCompleted\fP This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from  DescribeJob .
.UNINDENT
.sp
An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\(aqt have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see \fI\%Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\fP .
.sp
For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see \fI\%Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon S3 Glacier\fP and \fI\%Set Vault Notification Configuration\fP in the \fIAmazon Glacier Developer Guide\fP .

The \fBAccountId\fP value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single \(aq\fB\-\fP \(aq (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens (\(aq\-\(aq) in the ID.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
events-delete-rule \- Deletes the specified rule
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified rule.
.sp
Before you can delete the rule, you must remove all targets, using  RemoveTargets .
.sp
When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to the deleted rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
.sp
Managed rules are rules created and managed by another AWS service on your behalf. These rules are created by those other AWS services to support functionality in those services. You can delete these rules using the \fBForce\fP option, but you should do so only if you are sure the other service is not still using that rule.
.sp

If this is a managed rule, created by an AWS service on your behalf, you must specify \fBForce\fP as \fBTrue\fP to delete the rule. This parameter is ignored for rules that are not managed rules. You can check whether a rule is a managed rule by using \fBDescribeRule\fP or \fBListRules\fP and checking the \fBManagedBy\fP field of the response.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

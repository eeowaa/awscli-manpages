.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves information about all IAM users, groups, roles, and policies in your AWS account, including their relationships to one another. Use this operation to obtain a snapshot of the configuration of IAM permissions (users, groups, roles, and policies) in your account.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Policies returned by this operation are URL\-encoded compliant with \fI\%RFC 3986\fP . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the \fBdecode\fP method of the \fBjava.net.URLDecoder\fP utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

.sp
You can optionally filter the results using the \fBFilter\fP parameter. You can paginate the results using the \fBMaxItems\fP and \fBMarker\fP parameters.

.sp
\fBget\-account\-authorization\-details\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBUserDetailList\fP, \fBGroupDetailList\fP, \fBRoleDetailList\fP, \fBPolicies\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-filter\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of entity types used to filter the results. Only the entities that match the types you specify are included in the output. Use the value \fBLocalManagedPolicy\fP to include customer managed policies.
.sp
The format for this parameter is a comma\-separated (if more than one) list of strings. Each string value in the list must be one of the valid values listed below.

.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

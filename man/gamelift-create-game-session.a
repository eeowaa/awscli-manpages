.SH NAME
gamelift-create-game-session \- Creates a multiplayer game session for players in a specific fleet location
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a multiplayer game session for players in a specific fleet location. This operation prompts an available server process to start a game session and retrieves connection information for the new game session. As an alternative, consider using the GameLift game session placement feature with
.sp
with  StartGameSessionPlacement , which uses FleetIQ algorithms and queues to optimize the placement process.
.sp
When creating a game session, you specify exactly where you want to place it and provide a set of game session configuration settings. The fleet must be in \fBACTIVE\fP status before a game session can be created in it.
.sp
This operation can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To create a game session on an instance in a fleet\(aqs home Region, provide a fleet or alias ID along with your game session configuration.
.IP \(bu 2
To create a game session on an instance in a fleet\(aqs remote location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, along with your game session configuration.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If successful, a workflow is initiated to start a new game session. A \fBGameSession\fP object is returned containing the game session configuration and status. When the status is \fBACTIVE\fP , game session connection information is provided and player sessions can be created for the game session. By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using  UpdateGameSession to change the game session\(aqs player session creation policy.
.sp
Game session logs are retained for all active game sessions for 14 days. To access the logs, call  GetGameSessionLogUrl to download the log files.

.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Set of key\-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game session. For example, a game property might specify a game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when initiating a new game session. For more information, see the \fI\%GameLift Developer Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-creator\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for a player or entity creating the game session. This parameter is required when requesting a new game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy. This type of policy limits the number of concurrent active game sessions that one player can create within a certain time span. GameLift uses the CreatorId to evaluate the new request against the policy.

\fB\-\-game\-session\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIThis parameter is no longer preferred. Please use \(ga\(gaIdempotencyToken\(ga\(ga instead.\fP Custom string that uniquely identifies a request for a new game session. Maximum token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the new game session\(aqs ID.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-idempotency\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Custom string that uniquely identifies the new game session request. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once. Subsequent requests with the same string return the original \fBGameSession\fP object, with an updated status. Maximum token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the new game session\(aqs ID. A game session ARN has the following format: \fBarn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token>\fP . Idempotency tokens remain in use for 30 days after a game session has ended; game session objects are retained for this time period and then deleted.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-game\-session\-data\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-location\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A fleet\(aqs remote location to place the new game session in. If this parameter is not set, the new game session is placed in the fleet\(aqs home Region. Specify a remote location with an AWS Region code such as \fBus\-west\-2\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Sets the transition lifecycle of a recovery point.
.sp
The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. AWS Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.
.sp
Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.
.sp
Only Amazon EFS file system backups can be transitioned to cold storage.
.sp
Does not support continuous backups.
.sp

.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-backup\-vault\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the AWS Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

.sp
\fB\-\-recovery\-point\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example, \fBarn:aws:backup:us\-east\-1:123456789012:recovery\-point:1EB3B5E7\-9EB0\-435A\-A80B\-108B488B0D45\fP .

The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.
.sp
MoveToColdStorageAfterDays \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
DeleteAfterDays \-> (long)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus \fBMoveToColdStorageAfterDays\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH NAME
swf-terminate-workflow-execution \- Records a WorkflowExecutionTerminated event and forces closure of the workflow execution identified by the given domain, runId, and workflowId
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Records a \fBWorkflowExecutionTerminated\fP event and forces closure of the workflow execution identified by the given domain, runId, and workflowId. The child policy, registered with the workflow type or specified when starting this execution, is applied to any open child workflow executions of this workflow execution.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the identified workflow execution was in progress, it is terminated immediately.

\fBNOTE:\fP

If a runId isn\(aqt specified, then the \fBWorkflowExecutionTerminated\fP event is recorded in the history of the current open workflow with the matching workflowId in the domain.

.INDENT 3.5
You should consider using  RequestCancelWorkflowExecution action instead because it allows the workflow to gracefully close while  TerminateWorkflowExecution doesn\(aqt.

\fBAccess Control\fP

.UNINDENT
.sp
You can use IAM policies to control this action\(aqs access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use a \fBResource\fP element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
.IP \(bu 2
Use an \fBAction\fP element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action\(aqs parameters.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the caller doesn\(aqt have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute\(aqs \fBcause\fP parameter is set to \fBOPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED\fP . For details and example IAM policies, see \fI\%Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows\fP in the \fIAmazon SWF Developer Guide\fP .

\fB\-\-child\-policy\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If set, specifies the policy to use for the child workflow executions of the workflow execution being terminated. This policy overrides the child policy specified for the workflow execution at registration time or when starting the execution.
.sp
The supported child policies are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBTERMINATE\fP – The child executions are terminated.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBREQUEST_CANCEL\fP – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a \fBWorkflowExecutionCancelRequested\fP event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBABANDON\fP – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

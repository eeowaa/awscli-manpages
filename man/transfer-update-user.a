.sp
The response returns the \fBServerId\fP and the \fBUserName\fP for the updated user.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-home\-directory\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using their file transfer protocol client.
.sp
An example is \fByour\-Amazon\-S3\-bucket\-name>/home/username\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-home\-directory\-type\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users\(aq home directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to \fBPATH\fP , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it \fBLOGICAL\fP , you will need to provide mappings in the \fBHomeDirectoryMappings\fP for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPATH\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBLOGICAL\fP
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-home\-directory\-mappings\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You will need to specify the "\fBEntry\fP " and "\fBTarget\fP " pair, where \fBEntry\fP shows how the path is made visible and \fBTarget\fP is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your IAM role provides access to paths in \fBTarget\fP . The following is an example.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB\(aq[ "/bucket2/documentation", { "Entry": "your\-personal\-report.pdf", "Target": "/bucket3/customized\-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf" } ]\(aq\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope\-down policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("\fBchroot\fP "). To do this, you can set \fBEntry\fP to \(aq/\(aq and set \fBTarget\fP to the HomeDirectory parameter value.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0\-byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the AWS CLI, use the \fBs3api\fP or \fBefsapi\fP call instead of \fBs3\fP  \fBefs\fP so you can use the put\-object operation. For example, you use the following: \fBaws s3api put\-object \-\-bucket bucketname \-\-key path/to/folder/\fP . Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be considered a folder.

\fB\-\-policy\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Allows you to supply a scope\-down policy for your user so you can use the same IAM role across multiple users. The policy scopes down user access to portions of your Amazon S3 bucket. Variables you can use inside this policy include \fB${Transfer:UserName}\fP , \fB${Transfer:HomeDirectory}\fP , and \fB${Transfer:HomeBucket}\fP .
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For scope\-down policies, AWS Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the \fBPolicy\fP argument.
.sp
For an example of a scope\-down policy, see \fI\%Creating a scope\-down policy\fP .
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%AssumeRole\fP in the \fIAWS Security Token Service API Reference\fP .

\fB\-\-role\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The IAM role that controls your users\(aq access to your Amazon S3 bucket. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your S3 bucket or buckets. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users\(aq transfer requests.

\fB\-\-user\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique string that identifies a user and is associated with a server as specified by the \fBServerId\fP . This user name must be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 100 characters long. The following are valid characters: a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9, underscore \(aq_\(aq, hyphen \(aq\-\(aq, period \(aq.\(aq, and at sign \(aq@\(aq. The user name can\(aqt start with a hyphen, period, or at sign.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

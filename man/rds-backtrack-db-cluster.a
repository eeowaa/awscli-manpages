.sp
\fB\-\-backtrack\-to\fP (timestamp)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The timestamp of the time to backtrack the DB cluster to, specified in ISO 8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, see the \fI\%ISO8601 Wikipedia page.\fP
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the specified time isn\(aqt a consistent time for the DB cluster, Aurora automatically chooses the nearest possible consistent time for the DB cluster.

Constraints:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Must contain a valid ISO 8601 timestamp.
.IP \(bu 2
Can\(aqt contain a timestamp set in the future.

\fB\-\-force\fP | \fB\-\-no\-force\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates whether to force the DB cluster to backtrack when binary logging is enabled. Otherwise, an error occurs when binary logging is enabled.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-use\-earliest\-time\-on\-point\-in\-time\-unavailable\fP | \fB\-\-no\-use\-earliest\-time\-on\-point\-in\-time\-unavailable\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A value that indicates whether to backtrack the DB cluster to the earliest possible backtrack time when \fIBacktrackTo\fP is set to a timestamp earlier than the earliest backtrack time. When this parameter is disabled and \fIBacktrackTo\fP is set to a timestamp earlier than the earliest backtrack time, an error occurs.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

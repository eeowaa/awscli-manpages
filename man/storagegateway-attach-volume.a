.SH NAME
storagegateway-attach-volume \- Connects a volume to an iSCSI connection and then attaches the volume to the specified gateway
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Connects a volume to an iSCSI connection and then attaches the volume to the specified gateway. Detaching and attaching a volume enables you to recover your data from one gateway to a different gateway without creating a snapshot. It also makes it easier to move your volumes from an on\-premises gateway to a gateway hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-gateway\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway that you want to attach the volume to.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the iSCSI target used by an initiator to connect to a volume and used as a suffix for the target ARN. For example, specifying \fBTargetName\fP as \fImyvolume\fP results in the target ARN of \fBarn:aws:storagegateway:us\-east\-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw\-12A3456B/target/iqn.1997\-05.com.amazon:myvolume\fP . The target name must be unique across all volumes on a gateway.
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a value, Storage Gateway uses the value that was previously used for this volume as the new target name.

.sp
\fB\-\-volume\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume to attach to the specified gateway.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-network\-interface\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The network interface of the gateway on which to expose the iSCSI target. Only IPv4 addresses are accepted. Use  DescribeGatewayInformation to get a list of the network interfaces available on a gateway.
.sp
Valid Values: A valid IP address.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-disk\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique device ID or other distinguishing data that identifies the local disk used to create the volume. This value is only required when you are attaching a stored volume.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

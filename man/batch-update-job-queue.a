.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-job\-queue\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-state\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Describes the queue\(aqs ability to accept new jobs. If the job queue state is \fBENABLED\fP , it can accept jobs. If the job queue state is \fBDISABLED\fP , new jobs can\(aqt be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

\fB\-\-priority\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the \fBpriority\fP parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of \fB10\fP is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of \fB1\fP . All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (\fBEC2\fP or \fBSPOT\fP ) or Fargate (\fBFARGATE\fP or \fBFARGATE_SPOT\fP ). EC2 and Fargate compute environments can\(aqt be mixed.

.sp
\fB\-\-compute\-environment\-order\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Details the set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. This is one of the parameters used by the job scheduler to determine which compute environment should run a given job. Compute environments must be in the \fBVALID\fP state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (\fBEC2\fP or \fBSPOT\fP ) or Fargate (\fBFARGATE\fP or \fBFARGATE_SPOT\fP ). EC2 and Fargate compute environments can\(aqt be mixed.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. AWS Batch doesn\(aqt support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The order in which compute environments are tried for job placement within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the \fBVALID\fP state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (\fBEC2\fP or \fBSPOT\fP ) or Fargate (\fBFARGATE\fP or \fBFARGATE_SPOT\fP ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can\(aqt be mixed.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Retrieves information on VPC peering connections. Use this operation to get peering information for all fleets or for one specific fleet ID.
.sp
To retrieve connection information, call this operation from the AWS account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Specify a fleet ID or leave the parameter empty to retrieve all connection records. If successful, the retrieved information includes both active and pending connections. Active connections identify the IpV4 CIDR block that the VPC uses to connect.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-fleet\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A unique identifier for the fleet. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

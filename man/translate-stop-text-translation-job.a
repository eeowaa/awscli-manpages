.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Stops an asynchronous batch translation job that is in progress.
.sp
If the job\(aqs state is \fBIN_PROGRESS\fP , the job will be marked for termination and put into the \fBSTOP_REQUESTED\fP state. If the job completes before it can be stopped, it is put into the \fBCOMPLETED\fP state. Otherwise, the job is put into the \fBSTOPPED\fP state.
.sp
Asynchronous batch translation jobs are started with the  StartTextTranslationJob operation. You can use the  DescribeTextTranslationJob or  ListTextTranslationJobs operations to get a batch translation job\(aqs \fBJobId\fP .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

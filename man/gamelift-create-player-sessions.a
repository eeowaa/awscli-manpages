.SH NAME
gamelift-create-player-sessions \- Reserves open slots in a game session for a group of players
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Reserves open slots in a game session for a group of players. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in \fBACTIVE\fP status and has a player creation policy of \fBACCEPT_ALL\fP . To add a single player to a game session, use  CreatePlayerSession .
.sp
To create player sessions, specify a game session ID and a list of player IDs. Optionally, provide a set of player data for each player ID.
.sp
If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for each player, and new  PlayerSession objects are returned with player session IDs. Each player references their player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the GameLift service. Player sessions cannot be updated.

Any player data strings for player IDs that are not included in the \fBPlayerIds\fP parameter are ignored.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
PlayerSessions \-> (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A collection of player session objects created for the added players.
.sp
(structure)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Represents a player session. Player sessions are created either for a specific game session, or as part of a game session placement or matchmaking request. A player session can represents a reserved player slot in a game session (when status is \fBRESERVED\fP ) or actual player activity in a game session (when status is \fBACTIVE\fP ). A player session object, including player data, is automatically passed to a game session when the player connects to the game session and is validated. After the game session ends, player sessions information is retained for 30 days and then removed.

.SH NAME
glue-get-ml-transform \- Gets an AWS Glue machine learning transform artifact and all its corresponding metadata
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gets an AWS Glue machine learning transform artifact and all its corresponding metadata. Machine learning transforms are a special type of transform that use machine learning to learn the details of the transformation to be performed by learning from examples provided by humans. These transformations are then saved by AWS Glue. You can retrieve their metadata by calling \fBGetMLTransform\fP .

\fB\-\-transform\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The unique identifier of the transform, generated at the time that the transform was created.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.sp
PrecisionRecallTradeoff \-> (double)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value selected when tuning your transform for a balance between precision and recall. A value of 0.5 means no preference; a value of 1.0 means a bias purely for precision, and a value of 0.0 means a bias for recall. Because this is a tradeoff, choosing values close to 1.0 means very low recall, and choosing values close to 0.0 results in very low precision.
.sp
The precision metric indicates how often your model is correct when it predicts a match.
.sp
The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how often your model predicts the match.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AccuracyCostTradeoff \-> (double)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value that is selected when tuning your transform for a balance between accuracy and cost. A value of 0.5 means that the system balances accuracy and cost concerns. A value of 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results in a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value of 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less accurate \fBFindMatches\fP transform, sometimes with unacceptable accuracy.
.sp
Accuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall.
.sp
Cost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are consumed to run the transform.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
EnforceProvidedLabels \-> (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The value to switch on or off to force the output to match the provided labels from users. If the value is \fBTrue\fP , the \fBfind matches\fP transform forces the output to match the provided labels. The results override the normal conflation results. If the value is \fBFalse\fP , the \fBfind matches\fP transform does not ensure all the labels provided are respected, and the results rely on the trained model.
.sp
Note that setting this value to true may increase the conflation execution time.

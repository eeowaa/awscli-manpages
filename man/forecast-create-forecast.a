.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a forecast for each item in the \fBTARGET_TIME_SERIES\fP dataset that was used to train the predictor. This is known as inference. To retrieve the forecast for a single item at low latency, use the operation. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the  CreateForecastExportJob operation.
.sp
The range of the forecast is determined by the \fBForecastHorizon\fP value, which you specify in the  CreatePredictor request. When you query a forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast.
.sp
To get a list of all your forecasts, use the  ListForecasts operation.

The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.

\fB\-\-forecast\-types\fP (list)

.INDENT 3.5
The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts are generated. \fBYou can currently specify up to 5 quantiles per forecast\fP . Accepted values include \fB0.01 to 0.99\fP (increments of .01 only) and \fBmean\fP . The mean forecast is different from the median (0.50) when the distribution is not symmetric (for example, Beta and Negative Binomial). The default value is \fB["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"]\fP .

\fB\-\-tags\fP (list)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
.sp
The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum number of tags per resource \- 50.
.IP \(bu 2
For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum key length \- 128 Unicode characters in UTF\-8.
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum value length \- 256 Unicode characters in UTF\-8.
.IP \(bu 2
If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF\-8, and the following characters: + \- = . _ : / @.
.IP \(bu 2
Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
.IP \(bu 2
Do not use \fBaws:\fP , \fBAWS:\fP , or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has \fBaws\fP as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of \fBaws\fP do not count against your tags per resource limit.

Key \-> (string)

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

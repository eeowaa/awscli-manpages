.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items.
.sp
The types of information returned are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Form data (key\-value pairs). The related information is returned in two  Block objects, each of type \fBKEY_VALUE_SET\fP : a KEY \fBBlock\fP object and a VALUE \fBBlock\fP object. For example, \fIName: Ana Silva Carolina\fP contains a key and value. \fIName:\fP is the key. \fIAna Silva Carolina\fP is the value.
.IP \(bu 2
Table and table cell data. A TABLE \fBBlock\fP object contains information about a detected table. A CELL \fBBlock\fP object is returned for each cell in a table.
.IP \(bu 2
Lines and words of text. A LINE \fBBlock\fP object contains one or more WORD \fBBlock\fP objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn\(aqt have a relationship with the value of \fBFeatureTypes\fP ).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT \fBBlock\fP object contains information about a selection element, including the selection status.
.sp
You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the \fBFeatureTypes\fP list.
.sp
The output is returned in a list of \fBBlock\fP objects.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBAnalyzeDocument\fP is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use  StartDocumentAnalysis .

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.INDENT 3.5
A \fBBlock\fP represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a \fBBlock\fP object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText ), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.
.sp
An array of \fBBlock\fP objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of \fBBlock\fP objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

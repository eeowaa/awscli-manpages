.SH NAME
lakeformation-register-resource \- Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog.
.sp
To add or update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the chosen Amazon S3 path. Choose a role that you know has permission to do this, or choose the AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess service\-linked role. When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the service\-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service\-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy.
.sp
The following request registers a new location and gives AWS Lake Formation permission to use the service\-linked role to access that location.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

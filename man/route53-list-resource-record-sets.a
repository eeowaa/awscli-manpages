.SH NAME
route53-list-resource-record-sets \- Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBListResourceRecordSets\fP returns up to 300 resource record sets at a time in ASCII order, beginning at a position specified by the \fBname\fP and \fBtype\fP elements.
.sp
\fBSort order\fP
.sp
\fBListResourceRecordSets\fP sorts results first by DNS name with the labels reversed, for example:
.sp
\fBcom.example.www.\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order when the record name contains characters that appear before \fB\&.\fP (decimal 46) in the ASCII table. These characters include the following: \fB! " # $ % & \(aq ( ) * + , \-\fP
.sp
When multiple records have the same DNS name, \fBListResourceRecordSets\fP sorts results by the record type.

You can use the name and type elements to specify the resource record set that the list begins with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you do not specify Name or Type
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The results begin with the first resource record set that the hosted zone contains.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you specify Name but not Type
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to \fBName\fP .
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you specify Type but not Name
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Amazon Route 53 returns the \fBInvalidInput\fP error.

\fBChanging resource record sets\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record sets for a hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a \fBChangeResourceRecordSets\fP request while you\(aqre paging through the results of a \fBListResourceRecordSets\fP request. If you do, some pages may display results without the latest changes while other pages display results with the latest changes.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBDisplaying the next page of results\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If a \fBListResourceRecordSets\fP command returns more than one page of results, the value of \fBIsTruncated\fP is \fBtrue\fP . To display the next page of results, get the values of \fBNextRecordName\fP , \fBNextRecordType\fP , and \fBNextRecordIdentifier\fP (if any) from the response. Then submit another \fBListResourceRecordSets\fP request, and specify those values for \fBStartRecordName\fP , \fBStartRecordType\fP , and \fBStartRecordIdentifier\fP .

.sp
\fBlist\-resource\-record\-sets\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBResourceRecordSets\fP

Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.

\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo list the resource record sets in a hosted zone\fP
.sp
The following \fBlist\-resource\-record\-sets\fP command lists summary information about the first 100 resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws route53 list\-resource\-record\-sets \-\-hosted\-zone\-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the hosted zone contains more than 100 resource record sets, or if you want to list them in groups smaller than 100, include the \fB\-\-maxitems\fP parameter. For example, to list resource record sets one at a time, use the following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws route53 list\-resource\-record\-sets \-\-hosted\-zone\-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE \-\-max\-items 1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To view information about the next resource record set in the hosted zone, take the value of \fBNextToken\fP from the response to the previous command, and include it in the \fB\-\-starting\-token\fP parameter, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, \fBwww.example.com\fP . You can optionally include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats \fBwww.example.com\fP (without a trailing dot) and \fBwww.example.com.\fP (with a trailing dot) as identical.
.sp
For information about how to specify characters other than \fBa\-z\fP , \fB0\-9\fP , and \fB\-\fP (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see \fI\%DNS Domain Name Format\fP in the \fIAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide\fP .

You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the \fBName\fP and \fBType\fP elements.
.IP \(bu 2
For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set \fBWeight\fP to \fB0\fP for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set \fBWeight\fP to \fB0\fP for all resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting \fBWeight\fP to \fB0\fP is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets.

Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations.

Specifying a value for \fBHealthCheckId\fP is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check.

If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.

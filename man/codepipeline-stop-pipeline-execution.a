.SH NAME
codepipeline-stop-pipeline-execution \- Stops the specified pipeline execution
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Stops the specified pipeline execution. You choose to either stop the pipeline execution by completing in\-progress actions without starting subsequent actions, or by abandoning in\-progress actions. While completing or abandoning in\-progress actions, the pipeline execution is in a \fBStopping\fP state. After all in\-progress actions are completed or abandoned, the pipeline execution is in a \fBStopped\fP state.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-pipeline\-name\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The name of the pipeline to stop.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-pipeline\-execution\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the pipeline execution to be stopped in the current stage. Use the \fBGetPipelineState\fP action to retrieve the current pipelineExecutionId.

.sp
\fB\-\-abandon\fP | \fB\-\-no\-abandon\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use this option to stop the pipeline execution by abandoning, rather than finishing, in\-progress actions.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo stop a pipeline execution\fP
.sp
The following \fBstop\-pipeline\-execution\fP example defaults to waiting until in\-progress actions finish, and then stops the pipeline. You cannot choose to stop and wait if the execution is already in a Stopping state. You can choose to stop and abandon an execution that is already in a Stopping state.

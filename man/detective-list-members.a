.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-graph\-arn\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ARN of the behavior graph for which to retrieve the list of member accounts.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For requests to retrieve the next page of member account results, the pagination token that was returned with the previous page of results. The initial request does not include a pagination token.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum number of member accounts to include in the response. The total must be less than the overall limit on the number of results to return, which is currently 200.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo list the member accounts in a behavior graph\fP
.sp
The following \fBlist\-members\fP example retrieves the invited and enabled member accounts for the behavior graph \fBarn:aws:detective:us\-east\-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234\fP\&. The results do not include member accounts that were removed.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
MasterId \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The AWS account identifier of the administrator account for the behavior graph.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
AdministratorId \-> (string)

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status \-> (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The current membership status of the member account. The status can have one of the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBINVITED\fP \- Indicates that the member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBVERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS\fP \- Indicates that Detective is verifying that the account identifier and email address provided for the member account match. If they do match, then Detective sends the invitation. If the email address and account identifier don\(aqt match, then the member cannot be added to the behavior graph.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBVERIFICATION_FAILED\fP \- Indicates that the account and email address provided for the member account do not match, and Detective did not send an invitation to the account.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBENABLED\fP \- Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation to contribute to the behavior graph.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED\fP \- Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation but is prevented from contributing data to the behavior graph. \fBDisabledReason\fP provides the reason why the member account is not enabled.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Member accounts that declined an invitation or that were removed from the behavior graph are not included.
.UNINDENT

.sp
The reason can have one of the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBVOLUME_TOO_HIGH\fP \- Indicates that adding the member account would cause the data volume for the behavior graph to be too high.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBVOLUME_UNKNOWN\fP \- Indicates that Detective is unable to verify the data volume for the member account. This is usually because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty.
.UNINDENT

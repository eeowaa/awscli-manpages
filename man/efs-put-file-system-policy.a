.SH NAME
efs-put-file-system-policy \- Applies an Amazon EFS FileSystemPolicy to an Amazon EFS file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Applies an Amazon EFS \fBFileSystemPolicy\fP to an Amazon EFS file system. A file system policy is an IAM resource\-based policy and can contain multiple policy statements. A file system always has exactly one file system policy, which can be the default policy or an explicit policy set or updated using this API operation. EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit. When an explicit policy is set, it overrides the default policy. For more information about the default file system policy, see \fI\%Default EFS File System Policy\fP .
.sp
EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit.
.sp
This operation requires permissions for the \fBelasticfilesystem:PutFileSystemPolicy\fP action.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-file\-system\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The ID of the EFS file system that you want to create or update the \fBFileSystemPolicy\fP for.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fB\-\-policy\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBFileSystemPolicy\fP that you\(aqre creating. Accepts a JSON formatted policy definition. EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit. To find out more about the elements that make up a file system policy, see \fI\%EFS Resource\-based Policies\fP .

\fB\-\-bypass\-policy\-lockout\-safety\-check\fP | \fB\-\-no\-bypass\-policy\-lockout\-safety\-check\fP (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) A flag to indicate whether to bypass the \fBFileSystemPolicy\fP lockout safety check. The policy lockout safety check determines whether the policy in the request will prevent the principal making the request will be locked out from making future \fBPutFileSystemPolicy\fP requests on the file system. Set \fBBypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck\fP to \fBTrue\fP only when you intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from making a subsequent \fBPutFileSystemPolicy\fP request on the file system. The default value is False.

\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Lists the API keys for a given API.

API keys are deleted automatically 60 days after they expire. However, they may still be included in the response until they have actually been deleted. You can safely call \fBDeleteApiKey\fP to manually delete a key before it\(aqs automatically deleted.

\fBlist\-api\-keys\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBapiKeys\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-api\-id\fP (string)

.INDENT 3.5
The API ID.

.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Customers invoke AWS AppSync GraphQL API operations with API keys as an identity mechanism. There are two key versions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBda1\fP : This version was introduced at launch in November 2017. These keys always expire after 7 days. Key expiration is managed by Amazon DynamoDB TTL. The keys ceased to be valid after February 21, 2018 and should not be used after that date.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBListApiKeys\fP returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCreateApiKey\fP returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUpdateApiKey\fP is not available for this key version.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDeleteApiKey\fP deletes the item from the table.
.IP \(bu 2
Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as milliseconds. This results in a bug where keys are not automatically deleted because DynamoDB expects the TTL to be stored in seconds. As a one\-time action, we will delete these keys from the table after February 21, 2018.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBda2\fP : This version was introduced in February 2018 when AppSync added support to extend key expiration.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBListApiKeys\fP returns the expiration time and deletion time in seconds.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCreateApiKey\fP returns the expiration time and deletion time in seconds and accepts a user\-provided expiration time in seconds.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBUpdateApiKey\fP returns the expiration time and and deletion time in seconds and accepts a user\-provided expiration time in seconds. Expired API keys are kept for 60 days after the expiration time. Key expiration time can be updated while the key is not deleted.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDeleteApiKey\fP deletes the item from the table.
.IP \(bu 2
Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as seconds. After the expiration time, using the key to authenticate will fail. But the key can be reinstated before deletion.
.IP \(bu 2
Deletion is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as seconds. The key will be deleted after deletion time.

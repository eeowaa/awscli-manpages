.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns the description of a specific Amazon EFS file system if either the file system \fBCreationToken\fP or the \fBFileSystemId\fP is provided. Otherwise, it returns descriptions of all file systems owned by the caller\(aqs AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you\(aqre calling.
.sp
When retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally specify the \fBMaxItems\fP parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a response. Currently, this number is automatically set to 10. If more file system descriptions remain, Amazon EFS returns a \fBNextMarker\fP , an opaque token, in the response. In this case, you should send a subsequent request with the \fBMarker\fP request parameter set to the value of \fBNextMarker\fP .
.sp
To retrieve a list of your file system descriptions, this operation is used in an iterative process, where \fBDescribeFileSystems\fP is called first without the \fBMarker\fP and then the operation continues to call it with the \fBMarker\fP parameter set to the value of the \fBNextMarker\fP from the previous response until the response has no \fBNextMarker\fP .
.sp
The order of file systems returned in the response of one \fBDescribeFileSystems\fP call and the order of file systems returned across the responses of a multi\-call iteration is unspecified.
.sp
This operation requires permissions for the \fBelasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems\fP action.
.sp

.sp
\fBdescribe\-file\-systems\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBFileSystems\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-creation\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) Restricts the list to the file system with this creation token (String). You specify a creation token when you create an Amazon EFS file system.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-file\-system\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
(Optional) ID of the file system whose description you want to retrieve (String).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

kms-list-grants \- Gets a list of all grants for the specified customer master key (CMK)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gets a list of all grants for the specified customer master key (CMK).
.sp
You must specify the CMK in all requests. You can filter the grant list by grant ID or grantee principal.

The \fBGranteePrincipal\fP field in the \fBListGrants\fP response usually contains the user or role designated as the grantee principal in the grant. However, when the grantee principal in the grant is an AWS service, the \fBGranteePrincipal\fP field contains the \fI\%service principal\fP , which might represent several different grantee principals.

\fBlist\-grants\fP is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the \fB\-\-no\-paginate\fP argument.
When using \fB\-\-output text\fP and the \fB\-\-query\fP argument on a paginated response, the \fB\-\-query\fP argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: \fBGrants\fP

.sp
\fB\-\-key\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns only grants for the specified customer master key (CMK). This parameter is required.
.sp
Specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK. To specify a CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Key ID: \fB1234abcd\-12ab\-34cd\-56ef\-1234567890ab\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Key ARN: \fBarn:aws:kms:us\-east\-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd\-12ab\-34cd\-56ef\-1234567890ab\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-grant\-id\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns only the grant with the specified grant ID. The grant ID uniquely identifies the grant.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-grantee\-principal\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns only grants where the specified principal is the grantee principal for the grant.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP | \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP (string)
Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by \fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP\&. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-starting\-token\fP (string)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the \fBNextToken\fP from a previously truncated response.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-page\-size\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command\(aqs output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-items\fP (integer)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The total number of items to return in the command\(aqs output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a \fBNextToken\fP is provided in the command\(aqs output. To resume pagination, provide the \fBNextToken\fP value in the \fBstarting\-token\fP argument of a subsequent command. \fBDo not\fP use the \fBNextToken\fP response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.
.sp
For usage examples, see \fI\%Pagination\fP in the \fIAWS Command Line Interface User Guide\fP .
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-cli\-skeleton\fP (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value \fBinput\fP, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for \fB\-\-cli\-input\-json\fP\&. Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
.sp
See \(aqaws help\(aq for descriptions of global parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBTo view the grants on an AWS CMK\fP
.sp
The following \fBlist\-grants\fP example displays all of the grants on the specified AWS managed CMK for Amazon DynamoDB in your account. This grant allows DynamoDB to use the CMK on your behalf to encrypt a DynamoDB table before writing it to disk. You can use a command like this one to view the grants on the AWS managed CMKs and customer managed CMKs in the AWS account and Region.
.sp
This command uses the \fBkey\-id\fP parameter with a key ID to identify the CMK. You can use a key ID or key ARN to identify the CMK. To get the key ID or key ARN of an AWS managed CMK, use the \fBlist\-keys\fP or \fBlist\-aliases\fP command.

.sp
The output shows that the grant gives Amazon DynamoDB permission to use the CMK for cryptographic operations, and gives it permission to view details about the CMK (\fBDescribeKey\fP) and to retire grants (\fBRetireGrant\fP). The \fBEncryptionContextSubset\fP constraint limits these permission to requests that include the specified encryption context pairs. As a result, the permissions in the grant are effective only on specified account and DynamoDB table.

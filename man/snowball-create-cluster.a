.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates an empty cluster. Each cluster supports five nodes. You use the  CreateJob action separately to create the jobs for each of these nodes. The cluster does not ship until these five node jobs have been created.

If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON\-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON\-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&.

Similarly, if provided \fByaml\-input\fP it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with \fB\-\-cli\-input\-yaml\fP\&. If provided with the value \fBoutput\fP, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
